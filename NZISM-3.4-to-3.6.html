ask the vendor for an alternative method of managing the vulnerability;
install a version of the product that does not have the identified vulnerability;
install a different product with a more responsive vendor; or
engage a software developer to correct the software.

controls to prevent exploitation of the vulnerability including:

apply external input sanitisation (if an input triggers the exploit);
apply filtering or verification on the software output (if the exploit relates to an information disclosure);
apply additional access controls that prevent access to the vulnerability; or
configure firewall rules to limit access to the vulnerable software.

controls to contain the exploit including:

apply firewall rules limiting outward traffic that is likely in the event of an exploitation;
apply mandatory access control preventing the execution of exploitation code; or
set file system permissions preventing exploitation code from being written to disk; 
<span class="insert">allo</span>w<span class="delete">hite and black</span><span class="insert"> and deny </span>listing to prevent code execution; and

controls to detect attacks including:

deploy an IDS;
monitor logging alerts; or
use other mechanisms as appropriate for the detection of exploits using the known vulnerability.

controls to prevent attacks including:

deploy an IPS or HIPS; or
use other mechanisms as appropriate for the diversion of exploits using the known vulnerability, such as honey pots and Null routers.
