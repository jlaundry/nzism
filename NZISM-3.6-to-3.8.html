ask the vendor for an alternative method of managing the vulnerability;
install a version of the product that does not have the identified vulnerability;
install a different product with a more responsive vendor; or
engage a software developer to correct the software.

controls to prevent exploitation of the vulnerability including:

apply external input sanitisation (if an input triggers the exploit);
apply filtering or verification on the software output (if the exploit relates to an information disclosure);
apply additional access controls that prevent access to the vulnerability; or
configure firewall rules to limit access to the vulnerable software.

controls to contain the exploit including:

apply firewall rules limiting outward traffic that is likely in the event of an exploitation;
apply mandatory access control preventing the execution of exploitation code; or
set file system permissions preventing exploitation code from being written to disk; 
allow and deny listing to prevent code execution; and

controls to detect attacks including:

deploy an IDS;
monitor logging alerts; or
use other mechanisms as appropriate for the detection of exploits using the known vulnerability.

controls to prevent attacks including:

deploy an IPS or HIPS; or
use other mechanisms as appropriate for the diversion of exploits using the known vulnerability, such as honey pots and Null routers.

Stage
Description


1

Establish groups of all system resources based on similar security objectives.



2

Determine the information owner for each group of resources.



3

Obtain agreement from system owners.



4

Establish groups encompassing all system users based on similar functions or security objectives.



5

Determine the group owner or manager for each group of system users.



6

Determine the degree of access to the resource for each system user group.



7

Decide on the level of access for security administration, based on the internal security policy.



8

Identify any classification, protective markings and releasability indicators, (such as NZEO or compartmented information).

The MDM is capable of remotely applying agency security configurations for BYOD devices;
Mobile device security configurations are validated (health check) by the MDM before a device is permitted to connect to the agency’s systems;

“Jail-broken” devices are NOT permitted to access agency resources; 
Access to agency resources is limited until both the device and user is fully compliant with policy and SOPs;
Auditing and logging is enabled; and
Changes of Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card are monitored to allow remote blocking and wiping in the event of theft or compromise.
