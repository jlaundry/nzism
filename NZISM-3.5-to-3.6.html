How are the communications between the devices and directly accessed services secured?
How does an agency monitor and account for access made to directly accessed services?
How does an agency protect devices from compromise if they are able to directly access internet based resources, or be directly accessed from the internet?
How do directly accessed services authenticate the user of the agency device prior to granting access to the service (this is separate to authenticating the agency device itself)?
How does an agency enforce the use of multi-factor authentication with directly accessed services?
How does an agency authorise access to directly accessed services, and does this include from devices that are not authorised to connect to agency remote access services (authorisation and authentication are separate activities)?
How is access to directly accessed cloud services removed when staff no longer require access or leave the agency?

disable the functionality associated with the vulnerability though product configuration;
ask the vendor for an alternative method of managing the vulnerability;
install a version of the product that does not have the identified vulnerability;
install a different product with a more responsive vendor; or
engage a software developer to correct the software.

controls to prevent exploitation of the vulnerability including:

apply external input sanitisation (if an input triggers the exploit);
apply filtering or verification on the software output (if the exploit relates to an information disclosure);
apply additional access controls that prevent access to the vulnerability; or
configure firewall rules to limit access to the vulnerable software.

controls to contain the exploit including:

apply firewall rules limiting outward traffic that is likely in the event of an exploitation;
apply mandatory access control preventing the execution of exploitation code; or
set file system permissions preventing exploitation code from being written to disk; 
<span class="insert">allo</span>w<span class="delete">hite and black</span><span class="insert"> and deny </span>listing to prevent code execution; and

controls to detect attacks including:

deploy an IDS;
monitor logging alerts; or
use other mechanisms as appropriate for the detection of exploits using the known vulnerability.

controls to prevent attacks including:

deploy an IPS or HIPS; or
use other mechanisms as appropriate for the diversion of exploits using the known vulnerability, such as honey pots and Null routers.
