<xml><chapter title="1. About information security"><section title="1.1. Understanding and using this Manual"><subsection title="Objective"><paragraph title="1.1.1.">The New Zealand Information Security Manual details processes and controls essential for the protection of all New Zealand Government information and systems. Controls and processes representing good practice are also provided to enhance the baseline controls. Baseline controls are minimum acceptable levels of controls and are often described as &#x201C;systems hygiene&#x201D;.</paragraph></subsection><subsection title="Context"><block title="Scope"><paragraph title="1.1.2.">This manual is intended for use by New Zealand Government departments, agencies and organisations. Crown entities, local government and private sector organisations are also encouraged to use this manual.</paragraph><paragraph title="1.1.3.">This section provides information on how to interpret the content and the layout of content within this manual.</paragraph><paragraph title="1.1.4.">Information that is Official Information or protectively marked UNCLASSIFIED, IN-CONFIDENCE, SENSITIVE or RESTRICTED is subject to a single set of controls in this NZISM. &#xA0;These are essential or minimum acceptable levels of controls (baseline controls) and have been consolidated into a single set for simplicity, effectiveness and efficiency. &#xA0;</paragraph><paragraph title="1.1.5.">All baseline controls will apply to all government systems, related services and information. In addition, information classified CONFIDENTIAL, SECRET or TOP SECRET has further controls specified in this NZISM.</paragraph><paragraph title="1.1.6.">Where the category &#x201C;All Classifications&#x201D; is used to define the scope of rationale and controls in the Manual, it includes any information that is Official Information, UNCLASSIFIED, IN-CONFIDENCE, SENSITIVE, RESTRICTED, CONFIDENTIAL, SECRET, TOP SECRET or any endorsements, releasability markings or other qualifications appended to these categories and classifications.</paragraph></block><block title="The purpose of this Manual"><paragraph title="1.1.7.">The purpose of this manual is to provide a set of essential or baseline controls and additional good and recommended practice controls for use by government agencies. &#xA0;The use or non-use of good practice controls MUST be based on an agency&#x2019;s assessment and determination of residual risk related to information security.</paragraph><paragraph title="1.1.8.">This manual is updated regularly. &#xA0;It is therefore important that agencies ensure that they are using the latest version of this Manual.</paragraph></block><block title="Target audience"><paragraph title="1.1.9.">The target audience for this manual is primarily security personnel and practitioners within, or contracted to, an agency. &#xA0;This includes, but is not limited to:
security executives;
security and information assurance practitioners;
IT Security Managers;&#xA0;
Departmental Security Officers; and
service providers.
</paragraph></block><block title="Structure of this Manual"><paragraph title="1.1.10.">This manual seeks to present information in a consistent manner. &#xA0;There are a number of headings within each section, described below.
Objective &#x2013; the desired outcome when controls within a section are implemented.
Context &#x2013; the scope, applicability and any exceptions for a section.
References &#x2013; references to external sources of information that can assist in the interpretation or implementation of controls.
Rationale &amp; Controls&#xA0;

Rationale &#x2013; the reasoning behind controls and compliance requirements.
Control &#x2013; risk reduction measures with associated compliance requirements.

</paragraph><paragraph title="1.1.11.">This section provides a summary of key structural elements of this manual. &#xA0;The detail of processes and controls is provided in subsequent chapters. &#xA0;It is important that reference is made to the detailed processes and controls in order to fully understand key risks and appropriate mitigations.</paragraph></block><block title="The New Zealand Government Security Classification System"><paragraph title="1.1.12.">The requirements for classification of government documents and information are based on the Cabinet Committee Minute EXG (00) M 20/7 and CAB (00) M42/4G(4). &#xA0;The Protective Security Requirements (PSR) INFOSEC2 require agencies to use the NZ Government Security Classification System and the NZISM for the classification, protective marking and handling of information assets. &#xA0;For more information on classification, protective marking and handling instructions, refer to the Protective Security Requirements, NZ Government Security Classification System.</paragraph></block></subsection><subsection title="Key definitions"><block title="Accreditation Authority"><paragraph title="1.1.13.">The Agency Head is generally the Accreditation Authority for that agency for all systems and related services up to and including those classified RESTRICTED. &#xA0;See also Chapter 3 &#x2013; Roles and Responsibilities and Section 4.4 &#x2013; Accreditation Framework.</paragraph><paragraph title="1.1.14.">Agency heads may choose to delegate this authority to a member of the agency&#x2019;s executive. &#xA0;The Agency Head remains accountable for ICT risks accepted and the information security of their agency.&#xA0;</paragraph><paragraph title="1.1.15.">In all cases the Accreditation Authority will be at least a senior agency executive who has an appropriate level of understanding of the security risks they are accepting on behalf of the agency.</paragraph><paragraph title="1.1.16.">For multi-national and multi-agency systems the Accreditation Authority is determined by a formal agreement between the parties involved. &#xA0;Consultation with the Office of the Government Chief Digital Officer (GCDO) may also be necessary.</paragraph><paragraph title="1.1.17.">For agencies with systems that process, store or communicate NZEO or information compartmented for national security reasons, the Director-General of the GCSB is the Accreditation Authority irrespective of the classification level of that information.</paragraph></block><block title="Certification and Accreditation Processes"><paragraph title="1.1.18.">Certification and accreditation of information systems is the fundamental governance process by which the risk owners and agency head derive assurance over the design, implementation and management of information systems and related services provided to or by government agencies. &#xA0; This process is described in detail in Chapter 4 &#x2013; System Certification and Accreditation.</paragraph><paragraph title="1.1.19.">Certification and Accreditation are two distinct processes.</paragraph><paragraph title="1.1.20.">Certification is the formal assertion that an information system and related services comply with minimum standards and agreed design, including any security requirements.</paragraph><paragraph title="1.1.21.">In all cases, certification and the supporting documentation or summary of other evidence will be prepared by, or on behalf of, the host or lead agency. &#xA0;The certification is then provided to the Accreditation Authority.</paragraph><paragraph title="1.1.22.">Accreditation is the formal authority to operate an information system and related services, and requires the recognition and acceptance of associated risk and residual risks.</paragraph><paragraph title="1.1.23.">A waiver is NOT an exception (see below).&#xA0; A waiver is the formal acknowledgement that a particular compliance requirement of the NZISM cannot currently be met.&#xA0; A waiver is granted by the Accreditation Authority on the basis that full compliance with the NZISM is achieved or compensating controls are implemented within a time specified by the Accreditation Authority.&#xA0; Waivers are valid in the short term only and full accreditation cannot be granted until all conditions of the waiver have been met.&#xA0; The need for a waiver may occur when specified controls cannot be practically implemented because of technology, resource or other serious limitations.&#xA0; It is essential that risk is managed through the application of specified conditions.</paragraph><paragraph title="1.1.24.">An exception is NOT a waiver (see preceding paragraph).&#xA0; An exception is the formal acknowledgement that a requirement of the NZISM cannot be met and that a dispensation from the particular compliance requirement is granted by the Accreditation Authority.&#xA0; This exception is valid for the term of the Accreditation Certificate or some lesser time as determined by the Accreditation Authority.&#xA0; This may occur, for example, the system is to be in use for a very short time (usually measured in hours), or the requirement cannot be met and there is no viable alternative.&#xA0; It is essential that any consequential risk is acknowledged and appropriate measures are taken to manage any increased risk.</paragraph><paragraph title="1.1.25.">The requirements described above are summarised in the table below. &#xA0;Care MUST be taken when using this table as there are numerous endorsements, caveats and releasability instructions in the New Zealand&#xA0;Government Security Classification System that may change where the authority for accreditation lies.

This includes necessary and related services provided as part of the information system, for example; Telecommunication or Cloud Services.</paragraph></block><block title="Information Systems Governance"><paragraph title="1.1.35.">An integral part of enterprise governance consists of the leadership and organisational structures and processes to ensure that the agency&#x2019;s information systems support and sustain the agency&#x2019;s and Government&#x2019;s strategies and objectives. &#xA0;Information Systems Governance is the responsibility of the Agency Head and the Executive team.</paragraph></block><block title="Secure Area"><paragraph title="1.1.36.">In the context of the NZISM a secure area is defined as any area, room, group of rooms, building or installation that processes, stores or communicates information classified CONFIDENTIAL, SECRET, TOP SECRET or any compartmented or caveated information at these classifications. &#xA0;A secure area may include a SCIF (see below). &#xA0;The physical security requirements for such areas are specified in the Protective Security Requirements (PSR) Security Zones.</paragraph></block><block title="Security Posture"><paragraph title="1.1.37.">The Security Posture of an organisation describes and encapsulates the security status and overall approach to identification and management of the security of an organisation&#x2019;s networks, information, systems, processes and personnel. &#xA0;It includes risk assessment, threat identification, technical and non-technical policies, procedures, controls and resources that safeguard the organisation from internal and external threats.</paragraph></block><block title="Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF)"><paragraph title="1.1.38.">Any accredited area, room, or group of rooms, buildings, or installation where Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) is stored, used, discussed, processed or communicated. &#xA0;The Accreditation Authority for a SCIF is the Director GCSB or formal delegate.</paragraph></block><block title="System Owner"><paragraph title="1.1.39.">A System Owner is the person within an agency responsible for the information resource and for the maintenance of system accreditation. This may include such outsourced services such as telecommunications or cloud. Their responsibilities are described in more detail in Section 3.4 &#x2013; System Owners.</paragraph></block></subsection><subsection title="Interpretation of controls"><block title="Controls language"><paragraph title="1.1.40.">The definition of controls in this manual is based on language as defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)&#x2019;s Request For Comment (RFC) 2119 to indicate differing degrees of compliance.</paragraph></block><block title="Applicability of controls"><paragraph title="1.1.41.">Whilst this manual provides controls for specific technologies, not all systems will use all of these technologies. &#xA0;When a system is developed, the agency will determine the appropriate scope of the system and which controls within this manual are applicable.</paragraph><paragraph title="1.1.42.">If a control within this manual is outside the scope of the system then non-compliance processes do not apply. &#xA0;However, if a control is within the scope of the system yet the agency chooses not to implement the control, then they are required to follow the non-compliance procedures as outlined below in order to provide appropriate governance and assurance.</paragraph><paragraph title="1.1.43.">The procedures and controls described in the NZISM are designed, not only to counter or prevent known common attacks, but also to protect from emerging threats.</paragraph></block><block title="Identification and Selection of controls"><paragraph title="1.1.44.">In all cases controls have been selected as the most effective means of mitigating identified risks and threats. &#xA0;Each control has been carefully researched and risk assessed against a wide range of factors, including useability, threat levels, likelihood, rapid technology changes, sustainability, effectiveness and cost. &#xA0;</paragraph></block><block title="Controls with a &#x201C;MUST&#x201D; or &#x201C;MUST NOT&#x201D; requirement"><paragraph title="1.1.45.">A control with a &#x201C;MUST&#x201D; or &#x201C;MUST NOT&#x201D; requirement indicates that use, or non-use, of the control is essential in order to effectively manage the identified risk, unless the control is demonstrably not relevant to the respective system. &#xA0;These controls are baseline controls, sometimes described as systems hygiene controls.</paragraph><paragraph title="1.1.46.">The rationale for non-use of baseline controls MUST be clearly demonstrated to the Accreditation Authority as part of the certification process, before approval for exceptions is granted. &#xA0;MUST and MUST NOT controls take precedence over SHOULD and SHOULD NOT controls.</paragraph></block><block title="Controls with a &#x201C;SHOULD&#x201D; or &#x201C;SHOULD NOT&#x201D; requirement"><paragraph title="1.1.47.">A control with a &#x201C;SHOULD&#x201D; or &#x201C;SHOULD NOT&#x201D; requirement indicates that use, or non-use, of the control is considered good and recommended practice. Valid reasons for not implementing a control could exist, including:
A control is not relevant in the agency;
A system or ICT capability does not exist in the agency; or&#xA0;
A process or control(s) of equal strength has been substituted.
</paragraph><paragraph title="1.1.48.">While some cases may require a simple record of fact, agencies must recognise that non-use of any control, without due consideration, may increase residual risk for the agency. This residual risk needs to be agreed and acknowledged by the Accreditation Authority. In particular an agency should pose the following questions:
Is the agency willing to accept additional risk?
Have any implications for All-of-Government systems been considered?
If, so, what is the justification?
</paragraph><paragraph title="1.1.49.">A formal auditable record of this consideration and decision is required as part of the IA governance and assurance processes within an agency.</paragraph></block><block title="Non-compliance"><paragraph title="1.1.50.">Non-compliance is a risk to the agency and may also pose risks to other agencies and organisations. &#xA0;Good governance requires these risks are clearly articulated, measures are implemented to manage and reduce the identified risks to acceptable levels, that the Accreditation Authority is fully briefed, acknowledges any residual and additional risk and approves the measures to reduce risk.&#xA0;</paragraph><paragraph title="1.1.51.">In some circumstances, full compliance with this manual may not be possible, for example some legacy systems may not support the configuration of particular controls. &#xA0;In such circumstances, a risk assessment should clearly identify compensating controls to reduce risks to an acceptable level. &#xA0;Acceptance of risk or residual risk, without due consideration is NOT adequate or acceptable.</paragraph><paragraph title="1.1.52.">It is recognised that agencies may not be able to immediately implement all controls described in the manual due to resource, budgetary, capability or other constraints. &#xA0;Good practice risk management processes will acknowledge this and prepare a timeline and process by which the agency can implement all appropriate controls described in this manual. &#xA0;</paragraph><paragraph title="1.1.53.">Simply acknowledging risks and not providing the means to implement controls does not represent effective risk management.</paragraph><paragraph title="1.1.54.">Where multiple controls are not relevant or an agency chooses not to implement multiple controls within this manual the system owner may choose to logically group and consolidate controls when following the processes for non-compliance.</paragraph></block><block title="Rationale Statements"><paragraph title="1.1.55.">A short rationale is provided with each group of controls. &#xA0;It is intended that this rationale is read in conjunction with the relevant controls in order to provide context and guidance.</paragraph></block></subsection><subsection title="Risk management"><block title="Risk Management Standards"><paragraph title="1.1.56.">For security risk management to be of true value to an agency it MUST relate to the specific circumstances of an agency and its systems, as well as being based on an industry recognised approach or risk management guidelines. &#xA0;For example, guidelines and standards produced by Standards New Zealand and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).</paragraph><paragraph title="1.1.57.">The International Organization for Standardization has published an international risk management standard, including principles and guidelines on implementation, outlined in ISO 31000:2018 - Risk Management - Guidelines. &#xA0;Refer to the tables below for additional reference materials.</paragraph></block><block title="The NZISM and Risk Management "><paragraph title="1.1.58.">The ISM encapsulates good and recommended best-practice in managing technology risks and mitigating or minimising threat to New Zealand government information systems.</paragraph><paragraph title="1.1.59.">Because there is a broad range of systems across government and the age and technological sophistication of these systems varies widely, there is no single governance, assurance, risk or controls model that will accommodate all agencies information and technology security needs.&#xA0;</paragraph><paragraph title="1.1.60.">The NZISM contains guidance on governance and assurance processes and technological controls based on comprehensive risk and threat assessments, research and environmental monitoring.</paragraph><paragraph title="1.1.61.">The NZISM encourages agencies to take a similar risk-based approach to information security. &#xA0;This approach enables the flexibility to allow agencies to conduct their business and maintain resilience in the face of a changing threat environment, while recognising the essential requirements and guidance provided by the NZISM.</paragraph></block></subsection><subsection title="References"><paragraph title="1.1.62.">Key Standards

As the individual control security risk for non-compliance is not as high as those controls with a &#x2018;MUST&#x2019; or &#x2018;MUST NOT&#x2019; requirement, the Accreditation Authority can consider the justification for the acceptance of risks, consider any mitigations then acknowledge and accept any residual risks.</paragraph><paragraph title="1.1.64.R.03.">Deviations from the procedures and controls in the NZISM may represent risks in themselves. It is important that governance and assurance is supported by evidence, especially where deviations from the procedures and controls in the NZISM are accepted.&#xA0; In this case a formal approval or signoff by the Accreditation Authority is essential.

These third parties will place reliance on the application of controls from the NZISM. If the agency fails to implement all appropriate controls, the third party will be unaware that their information may have been placed at a heightened risk of compromise. As such, the third party is denied the opportunity to consider their own additional risk mitigation measures for their information in light of the agency&#x2019;s desire to risk manage controls from this manual.</paragraph><paragraph title="1.1.66.R.02.">Most New Zealand Government agencies will store or processes information on their systems that originates from another New Zealand Government Agency.

Reviewing non-compliance"><paragraph title="1.1.68.R.01.">As part of the process of providing justification for a dispensation to the Accreditation Authority, an assessment of the degree of compliance, identification of areas of non-compliance and determination of residual security risk is undertaken by the agency or lead agency. This assessment is based on the risk environment at the time the dispensation is sought. As the risk environment will continue to evolve over time it is important that agencies revisit the assessment on an annual basis and update it according to the current risk environment, and if necessary reverse any decisions to grant a dispensation if the security risk is no longer of an acceptable level.</paragraph><paragraph title="1.1.68.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="146">Agencies SHOULD review decisions to be non-compliant with any controls at least annually.</paragraph></block><block title="1.1.69.

Outsourcing information technology services and functions"><paragraph title="2.2.5.R.01.">In the context of this section, outsourcing is defined as contracting an outside entity to provide essential business functions and processes that could be undertaken by the Agency itself.Outsourcing may present elevated levels of risk and additional risks. Outsourcing therefore, requires greater consideration, demonstrable governance, and higher levels of assurance before committing to such contracts.</paragraph><paragraph title="2.2.5.R.02.">A distinction is drawn between important business functions and the purchase of services such as power, water, building maintenance, stationery and telecommunications. These services are not usually provided by the agency itself.Purchased services, as identified above, do NOT require accreditation or a third party review as defined in the NZISM. However, normal contract due diligence should be exercised before committing to these supply contracts.</paragraph><paragraph title="2.2.5.R.03.">Contractors can be provided with classified information as long as their systems are accredited to an appropriate classification in order to process, store and communicate that information. Contractors and all staff with access to the classified systems must also be cleared to the level of the information being processed. This ensures that when they are provided with classified information that it receives an appropriate level of protection.</paragraph><paragraph title="2.2.5.R.04.">New Zealand, in common with most developed countries, has agreements with other nations on information exchange on a variety of topics, including arms control, border control, biosecurity, policing and national security. The lead agency in each sector will usually be the controlling agency for each agreement. While the detail and nature of these agreements is sometimes classified, the agreements invariably require the protection of any information provided, to the level determined by the originator. Agencies that receive such information will be fully briefed by the relevant controlling agency or authority, before information is provided. It is important to note that there is no single list or source of such agreements.</paragraph><paragraph title="2.2.5.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Must" CID="216">Agencies engaging industry for the provision of off-site information technology services and functions MUST accredit the systems used by the contractor to at least the same minimum standard as the agency&#x2019;s systems.

The dynamic nature of the cloud and its related infrastructure;
No customer ownership or control of infrastructure;
Limited visibility of architectures and transparency of operations;&#xA0;
Shared (multi-tenanted) physical and virtual environments; and
May require re-architecting of agency system to optimise use of cloud services.
</paragraph><paragraph title="2.3.14.">While there is potential for significant benefit, flexibility and cost saving, any use of cloud services carries risk. &#xA0;All cloud computing decisions should be made on a case-by-case basis after a proper risk assessment, the agency technology architecture is developed and security is properly considered and incorporated.</paragraph><paragraph title="2.3.15.">There is also likely to be a significant mismatch in service-level agreements (SLAs) between existing systems and outsourcing arrangements and those of cloud-based services.</paragraph><paragraph title="2.3.16.">It is important to note that although agencies can outsource operational responsibilities to a service provider for implementing, managing and maintaining security controls, they cannot outsource their accountability for ensuring their data is appropriately protected, including any system or service decommissioning or termination.</paragraph><paragraph title="2.3.17.">The Government Chief Digital Officer (GCDO) has developed a risk and assurance framework for cloud computing, which agencies are required to follow when they are considering using cloud services.&#xA0;</paragraph></block><block title="Information Security and Zero Trust"><paragraph title="2.3.18.">Information security relates to the protection of information regardless of its form (electronic or physical).&#xA0; Within government, information security has traditionally been construed using the concepts of confidentiality, availability and integrity of information.</paragraph><paragraph title="2.3.19.">Relating these concepts to people who access, manage and use that information requires the use of methods to provide:
Authentication;
Authorisation; and

Cloud Adoption Strategy"><paragraph title="2.3.25.R.01.">Cloud technologies require a different mindset for the delivery of ICT services, as compared to traditional agency-owned IT servers. &#xA0;Increasingly, ICT will be available only in &#x2018;as-a-service&#x2019; delivery models, which may lead to agencies adopting cloud services in an ad-hoc manner unless an overarching strategy is developed and put in place.&#xA0;</paragraph><paragraph title="2.3.25.R.02.">This will introduce new and different risks, including:
where information is located;
where it is able to be accessed from;
who is able to access information; and
how ICT services are funded and sustained.
</paragraph><paragraph title="2.3.25.R.03.">Cloud providers are more likely to adopt modern security and development approaches, including agile development techniques (e.g. DevOps), Zero Trust Networking, serverless computing and continuous integration / continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines for automation.&#xA0; These approaches are likely to be incompatible with existing ICT processes that focus on legacy delivery models and may present significant challenges to agencies that are not adequately prepared.&#xA0;</paragraph><paragraph title="2.3.25.R.04.">Developing a strategy that outlines how an agency will look to exploit the opportunities presented by cloud while managing the risks and change required in ICT governance and management processes is essential to the successful adoption of cloud services for agencies.</paragraph><paragraph title="2.3.25.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Must" CID="7045">Agencies intending to adopt public cloud technologies or services MUST develop a plan for how they intend to use these services.&#xA0; This plan can be standalone or part of an overarching ICT strategy.</paragraph><paragraph title="2.3.25.C.02." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="7046">An agency&#x2019;s cloud adoption plan SHOULD cover:
Outcomes and benefits that the adoption of cloud technologies will bring;
Risks introduced or mitigated through the use of cloud, and the agency&#x2019;s risk tolerance;
Financial and cost accounting models;
Shared responsibility models;
Cloud deployment models;
Cloud security strategy;
Resilience and recovery approaches;
Data recovery on contract termination;
Cloud exit strategy and other contractual arrangements; and
A high level description of the foundation services that enable cloud adoption, including:

User, device and system identity;
Encryption and key management;
Information management;
Logging and alerting;
Incident management;
Managing privileged activities; and
Cost management.


</paragraph></block><block title="2.3.26. Zero Trust"><paragraph title="2.3.26.R.01.">Zero Trust is becoming the de-facto approach to ICT system security and is recommended by GCSB as the approach agencies should take, particularly as part of the adoption of cloud services.Zero Trust is a set of principles and outcomes, not an architecture or a solution.&#xA0; You cannot &#x2018;buy&#x2019; Zero Trust.Zero Trust is compatible with other ICT outcomes, such as improved access to information, increased agility and better security.Key aspects of Zero Trust focus on:
Visibility (through telemetry) and analytics of how services are functioning &#x2013; this comes through as focus on monitoring, event gathering and machine learning based analysis; and
Automation of service delivery and security actions.
</paragraph><paragraph title="2.3.26.R.02.">Public cloud services are often built following Zero Trust principles, and agencies will find adoption of this approach will lead to more successful security outcomes than trying to recreate legacy perimeter security controls in the cloud.</paragraph><paragraph title="2.3.26.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="7049">Agencies intending to adopt public cloud technologies or services SHOULD incorporate Zero Trust philosophies and concepts.</paragraph><paragraph title="2.3.26.C.02." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="7050">Agencies SHOULD leverage public cloud environment native security services as part of legacy system migrations, in preference to recreating application architectures that rely on legacy perimeter controls for security.</paragraph></block><block title="2.3.27. Risk Assessment"><paragraph title="2.3.27.R.01.">The adoption of cloud technologies will introduce a wide range of technology and information system risks in addition to the risks that already exist for agency systems. It is vital that these additional risks are identified and assessed in order to select appropriate controls and countermeasures. Trust boundaries must be defined to assist in determining effective controls and where these controls can best be applied.

The pace of this research is accelerating.</paragraph><paragraph title="2.4.4.">The development of quantum computing is a rapidly advancing area with multiple innovations being announced regularly, often eclipsing previous forecasts.</paragraph><paragraph title="2.4.5.">Quantum computers are not expected to fully replace classical computers as quantum effects are currently useful only on particular tasks. However quantum computers will be able to rapidly solve highly complex problems, well beyond the capabilities of today&#x2019;s supercomputers.</paragraph><paragraph title="2.4.6.">A prominent area of quantum computing applicability is in the field of cryptanalysis, and it is expected that they will be able to compromise or render ineffective many of the public-key cryptosystems currently in use.</paragraph><paragraph title="2.4.7.">It is important that agencies are aware of the potential impact developments in quantum computing are likely to have on critical security controls such as encryption.&#xA0; It is also important that they are preparing to act to minimise the disruptions that could be caused during migrations to post-quantum cryptography (cryptographic systems that remain secure after the widespread availability of quantum computing).</paragraph><paragraph title="2.4.8.">Currently there are no post-quantum cryptographic systems approved for use in the NZISM, however there are actions that agencies can undertake to prepare for the time when such systems are approved.</paragraph></block><block title="Post-Quantum Cryptographic Standards"><paragraph title="2.4.9.">International organisations are evaluating potential candidates for standardisation in post-quantum cryptography.&#xA0; GCSB will review applicable standards and consider them for incorporation into the NZISM when they are published.</paragraph><paragraph title="2.4.10.">When standards for quantum-resistant public key cryptography become available, GCSB may deprecate or withdraw support for existing classical cryptographic standards. Agencies should therefore be prepared to transition away from these algorithms possibly in the next 2-3 years, even though the standards to migrate to are still to be developed.</paragraph><paragraph title="2.4.11.">Until new quantum-resistant algorithms are standardised, agencies should maintain or strengthen their existing cryptographic position using the algorithms, protocols and key lengths specified in Chapter 17 of the NZISM.</paragraph></block></subsection><subsection title="References"><paragraph title="2.4.12.">Additional guidance on post-quantum cryptography can be found at:

Is the system a high value asset based on agency requirements?
Does the system protect sensitive information (e.g. key stores, passwords, root keys, signing keys, personally identifiable information, and classified information)?
Do other systems (internal or external to the agency) depend on the cryptographic protections in place on the quantum vulnerable system?
How long does the data need to be protected?

This element of the C&amp;A process is described in Section 4.4 &#x2013; Accreditation Framework.</paragraph><paragraph title="4.1.17.">Accreditation ensures that either sufficient security measures have been put in place to protect information that is processed, stored or communicated by the system or that deficiencies in such measures have been identified, assessed and acknowledged, including the acceptance of any residual risk.</paragraph></block><block title="Accreditation Authority"><paragraph title="4.1.18.">For agencies the Accreditation Authority is the agency head or their formally authorised delegate.</paragraph><paragraph title="4.1.19.">For multi-national, multi-agency systems or AoG systems, the Accreditation Authority is determined by a formal agreement between the parties involved.</paragraph><paragraph title="4.1.20.">In all cases the Accreditation Authority will be at least a senior executive who has an appropriate level of understanding of the security risks they are accepting on behalf of the agency.</paragraph><paragraph title="4.1.21.">Depending on the circumstances and practices of an agency, the agency head could choose to delegate their authority to multiple senior executives who have the authority to accept security risks for the specific business functions within the agency.</paragraph></block><block title="Conflicts of Interest"><paragraph title="4.1.22.">A conflict of interest is a situation in which a person has duties or responsibilities to more than one person, organisation or elements of a process, but is placed in a position where they cannot do justice to all. This includes, for example, when an individual's vested interests or concerns are inconsistent with organisational outcomes, or when an official has conflicting responsibilities. In the context of the C&amp;A process, a conflict of interest can occur when an individual has multiple roles, such as being both the system owner and the Accreditation Authority.</paragraph><paragraph title="4.1.23.">A conflict of interest has the potential to undermine impartiality and integrity of a process and the people involved in a process. It will also undermine the integrity of governance and information assurance derived from the C&amp;A process.</paragraph><paragraph title="4.1.24.">Conflicts of interest are normally managed though segregation of duties, the division of roles and responsibilities in order to reduce the ability or opportunity for an individual to compromise a critical process. Segregation of duties also reduces errors of interpretation or judgement and better manages risk.</paragraph><paragraph title="4.1.25.">It is important to note that in the C&amp;A process in the NZISM, the Certification Authority, System Owner and Accreditation Authority are independent of each other. In smaller agencies, the Assessor may also be the Certification Authority. Ideally this role will also be segregated.</paragraph></block><block title="Penetration Testing"><paragraph title="4.1.26.">Penetration tests are an effective method of identifying vulnerabilities in a system or network, and testing existing security measures and the implementation of controls. Penetration testing is also very useful in validating the effectiveness of the defensive mechanisms. This testing provides an increased level of assurance when system certification and accreditation is undertaken. It also demonstrates prudent risk management.</paragraph><paragraph title="4.1.27.">A penetration test usually involves the use of intrusive methods or attacks conducted by trusted individuals, methods similar to those used by intruders or hackers. Care must be taken not to adversely affect normal operations while these tests are conducted.</paragraph><paragraph title="4.1.28.">Organisations may conduct their own tests and regular simple tests are effective in maintaining the organisation&#x2019;s security posture. Because of the level of expertise required to effectively conduct more complex testing, comprehensive penetration tests are often outsourced to specialist organisations.</paragraph><paragraph title="4.1.29.">Penetration tests can range from simple scans of IP addresses in order to identify devices or systems offering services with known vulnerabilities, to exploiting known vulnerabilities that exist in an unpatched operating system, applications or other software. The results of these tests or attacks are recorded, analysed, documented and presented to the owner of the system. Any deficiencies should then be addressed.</paragraph></block></subsection><subsection title="System Certification and Accreditation Diagram"><paragraph title="4.1.30."/></subsection><subsection title="References"><paragraph title="4.1.31.">Additional information relating to systems governance, certification and accreditation can be found at:

Certification Audit"><paragraph title="4.2.10.R.01.">The purpose of a Certification Audit is to assess the actual implementation and effectiveness of controls for a system against the agency&#x2019;s risk profile, security posture, design specifications, agency policies and compliance with the Protective Security Requirements (PSR)&#xA0;and in particular the relevant NZISM components.</paragraph><paragraph title="4.2.10.R.02.">The extent and scope of the Certification Audit should consider the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of the audit against the risks and benefits of the system under review. Major or high-risk systems will require more detailed and extensive review than low-risk or minor systems.&#xA0; See also Section 4.3 Conducting Audits.</paragraph><paragraph title="4.2.10.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Must" CID="535">All systems MUST undergo an audit as part of the certification process.</paragraph></block><block title="4.2.11.

Certification does NOT imply that the residual security risk is acceptable or an approval to operate has been granted.</paragraph><paragraph title="4.2.11.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Must" CID="540">The certification authority MUST accept that the controls are appropriate, effective and comply with the Protective Security Requirements (PSR)&#xA0;and in particular the relevant NZISM components, in order to award certification.</paragraph></block><block title="4.2.12. Residual security risk assessment"><paragraph title="4.2.12.R.01.">The purpose of the residual security risk assessment is to assess the risks, controls and residual security risk relating to the operation of a system. In situations where the system is non-conformant, the system owner may have taken corrective actions. The residual risk may not be great enough to preclude a certification authority recommending to the Accreditation Authority that accreditation be awarded but the risk MUST be acknowledged and appropriate&#xA0;qualifications or limitations&#xA0;documented.</paragraph><paragraph title="4.2.12.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="543">Following the audit, the certification authority SHOULD produce an assessment for the Accreditation Authority outlining the residual security risks relating to the operation of the system and a recommendation on whether to award accreditation or not.</paragraph></block></subsection></section><section title="4.3. Conducting Audits"><subsection title="Objective"><paragraph title="4.3.1.">The effectiveness&#xA0;of information security measures for systems is periodically reviewed and validated.</paragraph></subsection><subsection title="Context"><block title="Scope"><paragraph title="4.3.2.">This section covers information on the process of undertaking a certification and accreditation audit.</paragraph></block><block title="Audit objectives, scope and criteria"><paragraph title="4.3.3.">The aim of an audit is to review and assess:
the risk identification and assessment;
design and complexity&#xA0;(including the system and security architectures);
any available assurance reports on support or outsourced services;
controls selection;
actual implementation and effectiveness of controls for a system; and
supporting information security documentation.
</paragraph><paragraph title="4.3.4.">Only information that is verifiable should be accepted as audit evidence.&#xA0; Audit evidence should be recorded.</paragraph></block><block title="Audit outcome"><paragraph title="4.3.5.">The outcome of an audit is a report of compliance and control effectiveness for the certification authority outlining areas of non-compliance for a system and any suggested remediation actions.</paragraph><paragraph title="4.3.6.">Part of this audit is an assessment of whether the control systems adequately identify and address risk and information security requirements.</paragraph></block><block title="Who can assist with an audit"><paragraph title="4.3.7.">A number of other agencies and personnel within agencies are often consulted during an audit. Agencies or personnel that can be consulted on physical security aspects of information security may include:
The NZSIS for Physical Security;
GCSB for TOP SECRET sites and Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities (SCIFs);
MFAT for systems located at overseas posts and missions;
The Chief Security Officer (CSO) may be consulted on personnel and physical security aspects of information security;
The CISO, ITSM or communications security officer may be consulted on COMSEC aspects of information security; and
The ITSM and System Owner on aspects of secure system design configuration and operation.
</paragraph></block><block title="Independent audits"><paragraph title="4.3.8.">An audit may be conducted by agency auditors or an independent security organisation.</paragraph></block></subsection><subsection title="Audit Evidence"><block title="Audit evidence reliability"><paragraph title="4.3.10.">The reliability of audit evidence is influenced by its source, nature and the circumstances under which the evidence is gathered.&#xA0; In general terms documentary evidence is more reliable than oral evidence, self-generated evidence less reliable than evidence gathered elsewhere and externally generated evidence is more reliable than internally generated evidence as internally generated evidence may be more susceptible to selective presentation.&#xA0;</paragraph><paragraph title="4.3.11.">Confirmation should be obtained that:
Risk owners have been identified; and
Each risk owner has sufficient accountability and authority to manage their identified risks.
</paragraph><paragraph title="4.3.12.">Audit evidence can be gathered through the following methods in order of preference:



Method


Description




Inspection


Physical&#xA0;inspections can provide an independent confirmation of the physical condition&#xA0;of the site or systems, its implementation and its management.




Analytical review


Reviews&#xA0;of records and documents will provide evidence of varying degrees of&#xA0;reliability depending on their nature and source.&#xA0; A review of the risk identification and&#xA0;selection of risk treatments is invaluable.




Enquiry


Here&#xA0;audit evidence is gathered by interview.&#xA0;&#xA0;Enquiries can be formal or informal and oral or written.&#xA0; It is essential that the auditor creates a&#xA0;written record of any enquiries conducted.




Observation


Observation&#xA0;of operations or procedures being performed by others with the aim of&#xA0;determining the manner of its performance only at that particular time.&#xA0; This may include checks on system&#xA0;configurations, change management processes or other key elements.




Computations


Rarely&#xA0;used for non-financial records but may include, for example, asset registers&#xA0;and validation of holdings of accountable equipment and software.



</paragraph></block><block title="Audit evidence sufficiency"><paragraph title="4.3.13.">The Sufficiency is the measure of the quality (not the quantity) of audit evidence.&#xA0; It is important, however, that a balance is struck between the extent of the audit, the nature of the system under review, agency risk and the cost, effort and benefit of the audit.&#xA0; Sufficient evidence should be obtained to allow the auditor to be able to draw reasonable conclusions on which to base the audit opinion.&#xA0; For evidence to be deemed sufficient, the following aspects should be considered:
Materiality.&#xA0; Materiality is the threshold where any distorted, missing and incorrect information is likely to have an impact on the risk and security of a system.&#xA0; Where it becomes clear that there are material deficiencies in the evidence presented more substantive tests may be required or the audit suspended until corrective action has been taken by the agency.
Risk assessment: It is almost impossible to validate every risk identification and selection of risk treatments.&#xA0; For larger systems a more practical approach may be to validate the identification and treatment of major risks and use sampling techniques for the balance.
Economy: Before gathering or requesting additional audit evidence, it is important to consider whether or not it is feasible or cost-effective to generate this evidence against the benefits, assessed value and time required.

Agency and system specific security risks"><paragraph title="5.3.6.R.01.">While a baseline of security risks with associated levels of security risk and corresponding risk treatments are provided in this manual, agencies will almost certainly have variations to those considered during the security risk assessment. Such variations could be in the form of differing risk sources and threats, assets and vulnerabilities, or exposure and severity. In such cases an agency will need to follow its own risk management procedures to determine its risk appetite and associated risk acceptance, risk avoidance and risk tolerance thresholds. Risk owners must be identified.</paragraph><paragraph title="5.3.6.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="802">Agencies SHOULD determine agency and system specific security risks that could warrant additional controls to those specified in this manual.</paragraph></block><block title="5.3.7. Contents of SRMPs"><paragraph title="5.3.7.R.01.">Risks within an agency can be managed if they are not known, and if they are known, failing to treat or accept them is also a failure of risk management.

Evacuating facilities"><paragraph title="5.7.4.R.01.">When evacuating a facility, it is important that personnel secure classified information and systems as they would at the end of operational hours.&#xA0; This includes, but is not limited to, securing media, logging off of workstations and securing safes and cabinets.&#xA0; This is important as an attacker could use such an opportunity to gain access to documents, applications or databases that a system user had already authenticated to or use another system user&#x2019;s credentials for a malicious purpose.</paragraph><paragraph title="5.7.4.R.02.">During an evacuation, the safety of staff is of primary importance.&#xA0; Where it is immediately obvious to wardens and/or staff that the securing of classified information and systems prior to the evacuation of a facility would lead to, or exacerbate, serious injury or loss of life to personnel, the facility may be evacuated without personnel following the necessary procedures to secure classified information and systems.</paragraph><paragraph title="5.7.4.R.03.">Where facilities are evacuated and classified information and systems have NOT been secured, the Chief Warden or Floor Warden MUST be notified as soon as possible.&#xA0; Steps should be taken to secure the site as soon as it is safe to do so.</paragraph><paragraph title="5.7.4.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Must" CID="922">Agencies MUST include in procedures for personnel evacuating a facility the requirement to secure classified information and systems prior to the evacuation.</paragraph></block></subsection></section><section title="5.8. Independent Assurance Reports"><subsection title="Objective"><paragraph title="5.8.1.">To provide assurance to System Owners, Certifiers, Practitioners and Accreditors and to assist system designers, enterprise and security architects where assurance reviews cannot be directly undertaken on service&#xA0;providers.</paragraph></subsection><subsection title="Context "><block title="Scope"><paragraph title="5.8.2.">Independent assurance reports are also variously referred to as third party assurance reporting, third party reviews, attestation reports and SAS 70 reports. It is important to note that SAS 70 has been superseded by the ISAE 3402 and SSAE 16 standards encompassing Type I and 2 and SOC 1, 2 and 3 reports. For reviews conducted in New Zealand the ISAE (NZ) 3402 or ISAE (NZ) 3000 standards are used. These various standards and report types are discussed later in this section. Agencies are likely to encounter a variety of report types, depending on the country of residence or country of jurisdiction of the service provider, or the geographic location of the data centre.</paragraph></block><block title="Purpose"><paragraph title="5.8.3.">Many organisations are outsourcing key components of their business such as telecommunications, data storage and cloud based services. Managing third-party relationships is particularly challenging with services provided from outside New Zealand. The global nature of these services and the global nature of associated risks must be recognised by organisations. As outsourced services are becoming more integrated with organisation&#x2019;s operations, they will have a larger impact on organisation&#x2019;s governance, assurance and control frameworks. It is important to note that risk ownership and accountability remains with agencies and respective risk owners, even when responsibility for specific functions have been outsourced.</paragraph><paragraph title="5.8.4.">Independent assurance reports provide customers and other interested parties with information on policies, procedures and controls related to the service provider&#x2019;s internal frameworks, control objectives and controls in cases where physical inspections and reviews by customers are impractical or not feasible. Service providers may also use the findings of such reports for their own purposes. These reports are used to understand the adequacy and effectiveness of the service provider&#x2019;s frameworks, control objectives, controls and implementation of controls. They allow:
Business owners to identify and understand the risks associated with the service delivery;
System owners to more fully assess system risks;
System designers and security architects to make informed judgements on system structures, controls, defensive measures, and enterprise integration; and
Regulators, certifiers and accreditors to obtain assurance over the service providers internal control structures and assess the suitability of system structures, controls and defensive measures.
</paragraph><paragraph title="5.8.5.">An independent assurance review or third-party audit is invariably undertaken by independent auditors who are not employees of the service provider or their customers. There are two common types of independent third-party reviews: attestation reviews and direct non-attestation reviews.</paragraph><paragraph title="5.8.6.">Attestation reviews, such as an ISAE 3402 review (see below), are generally conducted by accounting or consulting organisations and are based upon recognised attestation standards issued by professional bodies such as the American Institute of Certified Public Accounts (AICPA) or the New Zealand External Reporting Board (XRB).</paragraph><paragraph title="5.8.7.">Direct or non-attestation reviews include those performed by IT consultants or others and may not follow standards referred to previously. They may be based upon other external standards or industry developed criteria such as ISO 2700x, ISACA&#x2019;s COBIT, the IIA, NIST, or the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA).</paragraph></block><block title="Assurance"><paragraph title="5.8.8.">Assurance is derived from an assessment of:
A description of the service provider&#x2019;s business and control environment;
Terms and conditions of the service contract or other legally binding agreement;
Assertions supplied by the service provider (self-assessments);
An independent validation of service provider assertions;
Independent testing of controls implementation and effectiveness;
Assurance in the service design and security architecture; and
Assurance in the service components.
</paragraph><paragraph title="5.8.9.">In general terms, the more ICT services that are outsourced in an agency, the less direct control and visibility the CE and management have over enterprise operations. Therefore, there is an increased reliance on assurance reporting from suppliers. &#xA0;Unless this is recognised in service contracts or legal agreements, agencies may find they are unable to obtain sufficient levels of assurance over the business services and enterprise operations.</paragraph></block></subsection><subsection title="Assurance Standards and schemes"><block title="ISAE (NZ) 3000"><paragraph title="5.8.10.">ISAE (NZ) 3000 (Revised) is issued by the External Reporting Board (XRB) of the New Zealand Audit and Assurance Standards Board and is the umbrella standard for other (non-financial) assurance engagements conducted in New Zealand. The standard covers a wide variety of engagements, ranging from assurance on statements about the effectiveness of internal control, for example, to assurance on sustainability reports and possible future engagements addressing integrated reporting. It is a principle-based standard that underpins current and future subject-specific ISAEs (NZ).</paragraph></block><block title="ISAE (NZ) 3402"><paragraph title="5.8.11.">In New Zealand the XRB issued the ISAE (NZ) 3402 in 2014, revised in 2016. &#xA0;This standard has essentially the same requirements as the international standard ISAE 3402 (see below), with some New Zealand specific adaptations. &#xA0;Australia, Singapore and many other jurisdictions have adopted this approach in the issue of this standard with some jurisdiction specific adaptations.</paragraph></block><block title="ISAE 3402"><paragraph title="5.8.12.">The most commonly used international standard for independent assurance reports is the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) No. 3402, Assurance Reports on Controls at a Service Organization, issued in December 2009 by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB), part of the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC).</paragraph><paragraph title="5.8.13.">Based on its predecessor standard SAS 70 (1992), ISAE 3402 was developed to provide an international assurance standard for allowing public accountants to issue a report for use by user organisations and their auditors (user auditors) on the controls at a service organisation that are likely to impact or be a part of the user organisation&#x2019;s system of internal control over financial reporting.</paragraph><paragraph title="5.8.14.">Auditing and associated consulting firms were required to use ISAE 3402 for all related work after June 2011.</paragraph></block><block title="ISAE 3402 Report Types"><paragraph title="5.8.15.">The ISAE 3402 provides for a report on controls at a point in time (Type 1 Report) or covering a specified period of time, usually between six and twelve months (Type 2 Report).</paragraph><paragraph title="5.8.16.">A Type 1 report is of limited use as it cannot cover the operating effectiveness of controls and is generally used for new operations where there is no evidence or documented history.</paragraph><paragraph title="5.8.17.">A Type 2 report not only includes the service organisation's description of controls, but also includes detailed testing of the service organisation's controls over a minimum six month period.</paragraph><paragraph title="5.8.18.">It is important to note that the descriptions Type 1 and Type 2 represent an audit approach and should not be confused with SOC 1, 2 and 3 reports under SSAE 16 (see below).</paragraph></block><block title="ISAE 3402 Report Uses and Limitations"><paragraph title="5.8.19.">This standard is used to obtain reasonable assurance about whether:
The service organisation&#x2019;s description of its system fairly presents the system as designed and implemented throughout a specified period or a specific date;
The controls related to the control objectives stated in the service organisation&#x2019;s description of its system were suitably designed throughout the specified period or at the specified date;
Where included in the scope of the engagement, the controls were implemented and operated effectively to provide reasonable assurance that the control objectives stated in the service organisation&#x2019;s description of its system were achieved throughout the specified period.
</paragraph><paragraph title="5.8.20.">This ISAE applies only when the service organisation is responsible for, or otherwise able to make an assertion about, the suitable design of controls. It does not cover situations where:
reporting only whether controls at a service organisation operated as described; or
reporting on controls at a service organisation other than those related to a service relevant to user entities.
</paragraph></block><block title="ISAE 3402 Report Content"><paragraph title="5.8.21.">The ISAE 3402 report usually comprises:
The service auditor&#x2019;s report;
Assertions by the service provider;
A description of control objectives and controls provided by the service organisation;
Results of any tests and other information provided by the independent auditor; and
Any other information provided by the service provider.
</paragraph></block><block title="US Standard SSAE 16"><paragraph title="5.8.22.">The Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements No. 16 (SSAE 16) is issued by the Auditing Standards Board (ASB) of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). It includes additional requirements to the superseded SAS 70 standard by requiring management to provide a written assertion (see below) regarding the design and operating effectiveness of the controls being reviewed. It is possible that agencies may encounter an SSAE16 based report for a US-based entity.</paragraph><paragraph title="5.8.23.">SSAE 16 is the US equivalent of the international ISAE 3402 and came into effect on15 June 2011. While the SSAE 16 and ISAE 3402 standards have a common purpose and intent, , there are nine very specific requirements in SSAE 16, not covered in ISAE 3402:
Intentional acts by the service providers staff;
Anomalies;
Direct assistance;
Subsequent events;
Statement restricting use of the service auditor&#x2019;s report;
Disclaimer of Opinion;
Documentation completion;
Engagement acceptance and continuance; and
Elements of the SSAE 16 report that are not required in the ISAE 3402 report.
</paragraph><paragraph title="5.8.24.">These differences are summarised in the table below:


&#xA0;
SSAE 16
ISAE 3402


Use of report
Report specifically states it is restricted to intended users.
Report intended for user entities and their auditors but may include other restrictive use conditions.



Intentional Acts

Consideration of the impact of intention acts.
No requirement stated.


Subsequent Events
Auditors must consider Type 2 events after the report date.
Events after the report date are not considered.


Reporting
Sample deviations may not be discarded even when considered non-representative.
Sample deviations are assessed and may be discarded as not representative of the sample population.


</paragraph><paragraph title="5.8.25.">The SSAE 16 standard specifies Type 1 and 2 audits (as does ISAE 3402).</paragraph><paragraph title="5.8.26.">A Type 1 is a report on a description of a service organisation&#x2019;s system and the suitability of the design of controls. A Type 1 report will test the design effectiveness of defined controls by examining a sample of one item per control. This provides a basic level of assurance that the organisation has some controls in place. It does not measure the completeness or effectiveness of these controls and represents a point in time.</paragraph><paragraph title="5.8.27.">A Type2 report is a report on policies and procedures placed in operation and tests of operating effectiveness for a specified period of time. A Type 2 report undertakes the tests in a Type 1 report together with an evaluation of the operating effectiveness of the controls for a period of at least six consecutive calendar months.</paragraph></block><block title="AICPA Service Organisation Control Reporting (SOC Reports)"><paragraph title="5.8.28.">Service Organization Control (SOC) Reports, often known as SOC 1, SOC 2, and SOC 3 Reports, are derived from a framework published by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) for reporting on controls at service organisations.</paragraph><paragraph title="5.8.29.">In New Zealand, SOC 1 reports follow the ISAE (NZ) 3402 standard and SOC 2 reports are follow the ISAE (NZ) 3000 standard, in conjunction with the NZ Standard for Assurance Engagements SAE 3150, for assurance engagements on controls.</paragraph><paragraph title="5.8.30.">Each of the three SOC reports are designed to meet specific needs and reporting requirements for service organisations themselves, rather than being designed to provide assurance to third parties (customers). It is important to note that these reports follow the US (SSAE 16) and Canadian accounting standards, rather than the international ISAE 3402.SOC 1 Report &#x2013; Report on Controls at a Service Organization Relevant to User Entities&#x2019; Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Reporting on controls relevant to internal control over financial reporting and usually conducted in accordance with Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE) No. 16 and AT 801 &#x2013; Reporting on Controls at a Service Organization. A SOC 1 report can be based on a Type 1 or a Type 2 audit.SOC 2 Report&#x2014; Report on Controls at a Service Organization Relevant to Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality or Privacy. SOC 2 Reporting follows the AICPA AT Section 101 (not SSAE 16) and encompasses controls at service organisations on security, availability, processing Integrity, confidentiality and privacy. SOC 2 reports assist in comparing two or more data centres or service providers.SOC 3 Report&#x2014; Trust Services Report for Service Organizations. As well as reporting on controls relevant to security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality and privacy a SOC 3 report provides the same level of assurance about controls over security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality and/or privacy as a SOC 2 report. The key difference is that a SOC 3 report is intended for general release and does not include the detailed description of the testing performed by the auditor. In place of the detailed description a summary opinion regarding the effectiveness of the controls in place at the data centre or service organisation is provided.SOC Reports Summary

</paragraph></block><block title="Management Assertions"><paragraph title="5.8.31.">See Assertions in Certification and Accreditation (NZISM 3.4.3 to 3.4.7) for a short discussion on the nature and purpose of assertions.</paragraph><paragraph title="5.8.32.">The SSAE 16 requires a written assertion by management. Also known as a management&#x2019;s assertion or service organisation assertion it is essentially an assertion made by the service organisation representing and asserting to a number of elements, including:
The description fairly presents the service organisation's system;
That the control objectives were suitably designed (SSAE 16 Type 1) and operating effectively (SSAE 16 Type 2) during the dates and/or periods covered by the report; and
The criteria used for making these assertions, (which are additional statements with supporting matter regarding risk factors relating to control objectives and underlying controls) were in place (Type 1) and were consistently applied (Type 2).
</paragraph></block><block title="ISO/IEC 27001 Certification"><paragraph title="5.8.33.">ISO/IEC 27001 is an international standard that provides a framework for Information Security Management Systems. The standard is designed to help organisations of all sizes and types to select suitable and proportionate security controls for information. It provides a structured approach to assist in managing risk by identifying information security vulnerabilities and selecting appropriate controls.</paragraph><paragraph title="5.8.34.">This standard enables independent, external certification bodies to audit the ISMS and certify that the requirements of the standard have been met. Such certification is another means of deriving assurance over the operations of service providers. The requirements for certification are described in the ISO/IEC 27006:2015 standard. Certification is based on two reviews:
Stage 1 audit (also called Documentation review) checking the systems documentation is compliant with ISO 27001;
Stage 2 audit (also called Main audit) checking that all the organisation&#x2019;s activities are compliant with both ISO 27001 and the systems documentation.
</paragraph></block></subsection><subsection title="Other Guidance"><block title="Cloud Security Alliance&#x2019;s Security, Trust and Assurance Registry (STAR) Attestation"><paragraph title="5.8.35.">STAR Certification is a rigorous third party independent assessment of the security of a cloud service provider. It is based on the ISAE 3402 and SSAE 16 standards, supplemented by the criteria in the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM).</paragraph><paragraph title="5.8.36.">STAR is a free, publicly accessible registry that documents the security controls provided by various cloud computing service providers. The registry lists three levels of assurance:
Self-assessment;
Third party assessment based attestation or certification; and
Continuous monitoring based certification.
Note: Agencies should note that a self-assessment does not necessarily provide substantive assurance.</paragraph><paragraph title="5.8.37.">As at March 2017, the STAR scheme is still to be fully implemented although there are a number of cloud service providers listed in the registry.</paragraph><paragraph title="5.8.38.">Agencies can use this registry to further inform their judgement on the robustness of assurance over cloud service provider&#x2019;s internal operations and implementation of security controls.</paragraph></block><block title="Cloud Security Alliance&#x2019;s Cloud Controls Matric (CCM)"><paragraph title="5.8.39.">The CCM covers 16 control domains and provides fundamental security principles to guide cloud service providers and to assist prospective cloud customers in assessing the overall security risk of a cloud service provider.</paragraph><paragraph title="5.8.40.">The CCM references and maps its controls to internationally accepted industry standards, regulations, and control frameworks, such as ISO 27001/2/17/18, PCI: DSS v3, and AICPA 2014 Trust Service Principles and Criteria, Germany&#x2019;s BIS, Canada&#x2019;s PIPEDA, ISACA&#x2019;s COBIT, the US FedRAMP, HIPAA, Jericho Forum, NIST and the NZISM.</paragraph></block><block title="Cloud Security Alliance&#x2019;s Consensus Assessments Initiative Questionnaire (CAIQ)"><paragraph title="5.8.41.">The CAIQ is an extension to the CCM that provides exemplar control assertion questions that can be asked of service providers in the context of each CCM control, and can be tailored to suit each unique cloud customer&#x2019;s evidentiary requirements. The Government Chief Digital Officer (GCDO) maintain a mapping of the CAIQ questions to the GCIO Cloud Security and Privacy Considerations question set to further aid agencies in use of the CAIQ as an alternative to equivalent GCDO questions.</paragraph></block><block title="ISACA IT Audit and Assurance Program for Cloud Computing "><paragraph title="5.8.42.">Based on ISACA&#x2019;s IT Assurance Framework (ITAF), the Cloud Computing Assurance Program was developed as a comprehensive and good-practice model, aligned with the ISACA COBIT 5 framework. Building on the generic assurance program, the cloud computing guidance identifies a number of cloud specific risk areas encompassing:
Greater dependency on third parties;
Increased complexity of compliance with national and international laws and regulations;
Reliance on the Internet as the primary conduit to the enterprise&#x2019;s data; and
Risk due to the dynamic nature of cloud computing.
</paragraph><paragraph title="5.8.43.">The ITAF assurance focus is on: 
The governance affecting cloud computing;
The contractual compliance between the service provider and customer;
Privacy and regulation issues concerning cloud computing; and
Cloud computing specific attention points.
</paragraph><paragraph title="5.8.44.">It is important to note that this cloud computing assurance review is not designed to provide assurance on the design and operational effectiveness of the cloud computing service provider&#x2019;s internal controls, as this assurance is often provided through ISAE 3604 or similar reviews.</paragraph><paragraph title="5.8.45.">The cloud computing assurance review focusses on the agency&#x2019;s or organisation&#x2019;s systems design and operational effectiveness in relation to cloud services. It is also important to note that this is dependent on the effectiveness of the underlying system design and controls and how well these are implemented and managed.</paragraph></block><block title="ASD Certified Cloud Services"><paragraph title="5.8.46.">The Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) conducts certification of cloud services based in Australia for Australian government use. ASD Certifications are based on the Australian Government Information Security Manual (ISM). It is important to note that there are detail differences between the Australian ISM and the NZISM and these documents have a different legislative and regulatory basis.</paragraph><paragraph title="5.8.47.">The ASD Cloud Computing Security documents describe security risk mitigations associated with cloud computing. Australian Government agencies are also required to perform due diligence reviews of the legal, financial and privacy risks associated with procuring cloud services, aspects which are not covered by the ASD certification.</paragraph></block><block title="NIST 800-53"><paragraph title="5.8.48.">The NIST Special Publication 800-53 Revision 4 - Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations is the US unified information security framework for US federal government agencies. The New Zealand equivalent is the NZISM.</paragraph><paragraph title="5.8.49.">The underlying mandates are in FIPS Publication 200, Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems and FIPS Publication 199, Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems. US federal government agencies are required to categorise and analyse their system in terms of FIPS 199 and 200 then apply appropriate controls from NIST 800-53.</paragraph></block><block title="FedRAMP"><paragraph title="5.8.50.">The US Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) is a government-wide program intended to provide a standardised approach to security assessment, authorisation, and continuous monitoring for cloud products and services. This approach is designed to provide reusable cloud security assessments in order to reduce cost, resource and time. In addition it was intended to minimise cybersecurity risk for Federal Agencies as they move operations to the cloud, provide consistent baseline security policies and streamline the procurement process.</paragraph><paragraph title="5.8.51.">FedRAMP is a collaboration of cybersecurity and cloud experts from the General Services Administration (GSA), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Department of Defense (DOD), National Security Agency (NSA), Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the Federal Chief Information Officer (CIO) Council and its working groups, as well as private industry.The FedRAMP programme is run by the FedRAMP Program Management Office as part of the GSA.</paragraph><paragraph title="5.8.52.">FedRAMP is mandatory for Federal Agency cloud deployments at all risk impact levels.&#xA0; Private cloud deployments from single agencies and fully implemented within federal facilities are an exception to this mandate.&#xA0; Quaterly reporting by each agency on their cloud portfolio is required.</paragraph><paragraph title="5.8.53.">FedRAMP authorises cloud systems in a three step process:
Security Assessment: The security assessment process uses a standardised set of requirements in accordance with FISMA using a baseline set of NIST 800-53 controls with additional controls specific to cloud deployments, in order to grant security authorisations. Cryptographic elements are governed by the FIPS 140-2 standards.
Leveraging and Authorisation: Federal agencies view security authorisation packages in the FedRAMP repository and leverage the security authorisation packages to grant a security authorisation at their own agency.
Ongoing Assessment &amp; Authorisation: Once an authorisation is granted, ongoing assessment and authorisation activities are required to maintain the security authorisation.
</paragraph><paragraph title="5.8.54.">Again it is important to note that the FedRAMP assessments are conducted on a different legislative and regulatory basis to assessments conducted in New Zealand. A variety of guidance, controls, templates and other documentation is available online from the GSA (see References - Assurance Guidance )</paragraph></block><block title="PCI DSS"><paragraph title="5.8.55.">The Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council was formed by major credit card organisations and is a global open body formed to develop and promote understanding of essential security standards for payment account security. It develops, maintains and promotes the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS). It also provides tools to assist the implementation of the standards such as assessment and scanning qualifications, self-assessment questionnaires, training and education, and product certification programs.</paragraph><paragraph title="5.8.56.">This standard is designed to protect cardholder data (credit and debit cards) held by merchants, banks and other financial organisations. It applies to all organisations that accept, store, process and transmit credit cardholder data.</paragraph><paragraph title="5.8.57.">This standard is narrowly focussed and has specific applicability to New Zealand Government agencies that operate financial transaction services (e.g. AoG Banking services and citizen fee-paying services; such as vehicle registration, passport renewal, etc.). The PCI has published an information supplement on Third-Party Security Assurance (updated March 2016).</paragraph></block><block title="COSO"><paragraph title="5.8.58.">The Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) initially developed the COSO Internal Control-Integrated Framework in 1992. A revised framework was published in 2013 which included guidance on &#x201C;outsourced service providers&#x201D; and how they impact risk assessment, controls, monitoring, information flows and assurance. The 2013 Framework incorporates how organisations should manage IT innovation in light of globalisation, complex business processes, regulatory demands and security risk assessments. It is frequently used as the basis for SSAE16 assignments and the production of SOC reports.</paragraph></block></subsection><subsection title="References &#x2013; Assurance Standards"><paragraph title="5.8.59.">Further information on Assurance Standards can be found in:

</paragraph></subsection><subsection title="Rationale &amp; Controls"><block title="5.8.61. Risk Assessment "><paragraph title="5.8.61.R.01.">The Security Risk Management Plan (SRMP &#x2013; Section 5.3) encompasses all risks associated with the security of agency systems. The growth in outsourced services, particularly cloud services, has created situations where risk, controls and assurance cannot be directly examined and assessed. In such cases independent assurance reports are an effective means, possibly the only means, of obtaining some assurance on the service provider&#x2019;s operations.</paragraph><paragraph title="5.8.61.R.02.">No single independent assurance scheme/standard covers the full range of considerations and control requirements of the NZISM. Agencies may find duplication of aspects analysed if multiple schemes are applied. . It is also important to note that none of the common mature assurance schemes cover specific government requirements and handling of Official Information; such as the personnel aspects (PERSEC) of user and administration vetting and security clearances, or sovereignty aspects of the information/data. Careful selection and consideration is required when placing reliance on reports available for a particular outsourced or cloud service.</paragraph><paragraph title="5.8.61.R.03.">Reports from different assurance scheme have varying levels of detail as well as risk area coverage. Selection and usage of reports should be considered in the context of the intended service/system business and information value.Understanding the business and technical risk context will drive the size and depth of a risk assessment, and the associated assurance process. Though even a lighter-weight risk assurance process will follow the C&amp;A process model, such that the CE or authorised delegate is still formally accountable and responsible.Re-use of assessments completed by other agencies is encouraged, noting the business or information value context may differ. To assist agencies and promote efficiency, the Government Chief Digital Officer (GCDO) facilitates the sharing and re-use of existing cloud assessment materials among agencies.</paragraph><paragraph title="5.8.61.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Must" CID="1019">Agencies MUST conduct a risk assessment in order to determine the type and level of independent assurance required to satisfy certification and accreditation requirements.</paragraph><paragraph title="5.8.61.C.02." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="1020">In all cases where assurance on service provider operations cannot be obtained directly, agencies SHOULD obtain independent assurance reports.</paragraph><paragraph title="5.8.61.C.03." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="1021">In order to address identified risk areas, agencies SHOULD obtain relevant assurance reports and service provider certifications to inform a risk assessment and Certification activities as well as other aspects of the certification processes such as evidence of controls effectiveness and remediation plans.</paragraph></block><block title="5.8.62. Independent Assurance"><paragraph title="5.8.62.R.01.">Independent assurance can be obtained directly from the service provider through Service Organisation Control (SOC) reports, as well as other internationally recognised assurance frameworks. It will be important to corroborate individual reports by comparison with other reporting mechanisms and independent certifications.</paragraph><paragraph title="5.8.62.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Must" CID="1024">Agencies MUST incorporate the results of any independent assurance reports into the agency Certification process, to understand the residual risk position and controls required to manage risk appropriately.</paragraph></block></subsection></section><section title="5.9. Vulnerability Disclosure Policy (VDP)"><subsection title="Objective"><paragraph title="5.9.1.">Agencies implement a Vulnerability Disclosure Policy (VDP) to enable members of the public to report vulnerabilities in the agency&#x2019;s public-facing systems and applications and receive feedback on such reports.</paragraph></subsection><subsection title="Context"><block title="Scope"><paragraph title="5.9.2.">This section provides information on vulnerability disclosure for all externally-facing agency systems, including public-facing systems.&#xA0; Vulnerability disclosure relating to internal systems is covered in Chapter 12 &#x2013; Product Security.&#xA0;</paragraph><paragraph title="5.9.3.">When selecting which systems, applications and data are within scope of a VDP, agencies may consider:
The sensitivity of information on the agency&#x2019;s systems, including financial data, medical information, proprietary information, customer data or other personally identifiable information (PII).
Security safeguards that are already in place on the system, such as encryption of data at rest.
The agency&#x2019;s ability to segment its network or otherwise segregate sensitive information stored on its systems.
Regulatory, contractual, privacy or other restrictions placed on disclosure of protected classes of information (such as within the New Zealand Classification System).
</paragraph><paragraph title="5.9.4.">Reference to other chapters and sections in this document is essential.&#xA0; In particular:

</paragraph></block><block title="Agencies must expect vulnerabilities"><paragraph title="5.9.5.">Invariably all software, operating systems and applications have the potential to house exploitable vulnerabilities.&#xA0; Many vulnerabilities are identified by users and other third parties. Some vulnerabilities may be undiscovered or inherent in the application or software.&#xA0; Others may be introduced during upgrades, patches, configuration or other changes.&#xA0;</paragraph><paragraph title="5.9.6.">It is essential that agencies establish a policy and processes to identify and remediate such vulnerabilities.</paragraph></block><block title="Agencies must establish a vulnerability reporting mechanism"><paragraph title="5.9.7.">Published VDPs demonstrate that an agency has a mature and constructive approach when they receive a vulnerability report and also demonstrates openness and transparency in the management of agency systems.</paragraph><paragraph title="5.9.8.">Agencies should establish a process to allow any user (whether a member of the public, business partners, other agencies or agency staff), to report potential vulnerabilities.&#xA0; Any such reporting is on a &#x201C;no blame&#x201D; basis, without fear of repercussion or penalty, provided the agency&#x2019;s disclosure policy is followed and no illegal activity is undertaken.</paragraph><paragraph title="5.9.9.">The VDP must clearly state the conditions under which reports are received.&#xA0; In general terms this also includes a &#x201C;no bug bounty&#x201D; clause as well as limits on web site, system or application probing.</paragraph><paragraph title="5.9.10.">An agency&#x2019;s VDP will necessarily reflect that they may not control or own all of the software they use or the maintenance and development of underlying software (such as compilers, programming or scripting languages and so on).&#xA0; The VDP should clearly state that while the agency can receive reports about software, systems or services run on their behalf by third parties, providers or vendors, they may have to work with the reporting party to report the vulnerability to the relevant vendor.</paragraph><paragraph title="5.9.11.">Where specific legislation applies, for example a reported vulnerability may breach the Privacy Act, agencies must adhere to the legislation.&#xA0; This may change how reports are managed and action communicated to the finder or reporter.&#xA0; This does not change the requirement to maintain communication with the reporter/finder.</paragraph></block><block title="Agencies are expected to find and remediate vulnerabilities"><paragraph title="5.9.12.">The Protective Security Requirements places clear expectations on agencies to maintain awareness of vulnerabilities (see mandatory requirement INFOSEC4).</paragraph><paragraph title="5.9.13.">Section 12.4 of the NZISM sets out expectations and controls to ensure security patches are applied in a timely manner.</paragraph><paragraph title="5.9.14.">The disclosure period commonly used by many vendors, manufacturers and government agencies is 90 days.&#xA0; Vulnerabilities will be either patched, mitigated or managed within this period.&#xA0; In some cases earlier notification is provided to allow users to take mitigating actions until a patch or other solution is available.</paragraph><paragraph title="5.9.15.">VDPs are expected to include a timeframe within which patches will be applied or remedial action taken when a vulnerability is reported to the agency.</paragraph></block><block title="Agencies to create a vulnerability reporting point"><paragraph title="5.9.16.">When security risks in agency services are discovered and reported to the agency, it is vital that a robust communication channel is available to receive the report.</paragraph><paragraph title="5.9.17.">This is commonly described as a &#x201C;security.txt&#x201D;.&#xA0; A draft standard has been published (see References below) to help agencies (and other organisations) outline a process for security researchers to securely report security vulnerabilities.</paragraph></block><block title="Vulnerability disclosure policies are a normal part of learning about and patching vulnerabilities"><paragraph title="5.9.18.">Vulnerability disclosure (sometimes also referred to as responsible disclosure or coordinated vulnerability disclosure) is now an internationally accepted practice for technology organisations.&#xA0; The practice of vulnerability disclosure in modern computing dates to the late 1980s.&#xA0; There are related examples (non-computing) which appeared in the mid-1800s when locksmiths exchanged vulnerability information.</paragraph></block><block title="Bug Bounties"><paragraph title="5.9.19.">&#x201C;Bug bounties&#x201D; are a monetary reward to security researchers for the discovery and reporting of software and other information system vulnerabilities to the agency.&#xA0; Bug Bounties are separate to VDPs and should only be covered if the agency has a bug bounty programme in place.</paragraph></block><block title="Vulnerability disclosure policy (VDP) Content"><paragraph title="5.9.20.">A VDP will typically include:
A scoping statement setting out which systems the policy applies to (e.g. the agency&#x2019;s website and other public-facing systems);
Details of how finders can contact the agency&#x2019;s security team (including any public keys for encrypting reports);
Permitted activities;
Acknowledgement of reports and a response time (typically 60 or 90 days) for corrections, adjustments, or other &#x201C;fixes&#x201D;;
Reporters/finders agreeing to not share information about the vulnerability until the end of the disclosure period, to let the organisation fix the issues before it becomes public;
Illegal activities are not permitted (specifying any relevant legislation, such as the Crimes Act, the Privacy Act etc.); and
Either a statement that bug bounties will not be paid for any discoveries, or information about the agency&#x2019;s bug bounty programme.

</paragraph></subsection><subsection title="Rationale &amp; Controls"><block title="7.1.7. Preventing and detecting information security incidents"><paragraph title="7.1.7.R.01.">Processes and procedures for the detection of information security incidents will assist in mitigating attacks using the most common vectors in systems exploits.</paragraph><paragraph title="7.1.7.R.02.">New or advanced attacks and exploits can frequently be detected through other metrics and effects, rather than direct identification.</paragraph><paragraph title="7.1.7.R.03.">Many potential information security incidents are noticed by personnel rather than automated or other software tools. Personnel should be well trained and aware of information security issues and indicators of possible information security incidents.</paragraph><paragraph title="7.1.7.R.04.">Agencies may consider some of the tools described in the table below for detecting potential information security incidents.&#xA0;


Tool
Description


Network and host Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs)
Monitor and analyse network and host activity, usually relying on a list of known attack signatures to recognise/detect malicious activity and potential information security incidents.


Anomaly detection systems
Monitor network and host activities that do not conform to normal system activity.


Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) and Host Based Intrusion Prevention Systems (HIPS)
Some IDSs are combined with functionality to counter detected attacks or anomalous activity (IDS/IPS). &#xA0;


System integrity verification and integrity checking
Used to detect changes to critical system components such as files, directories or services. &#xA0;These changes may alert a system administrator to unauthorised changes that could signify an attack on the system and inadvertent system changes that render the system open to attack.


Log analysis
Involves collecting and analysing event logs using pattern recognition to detect anomalous activities.


White Listing
Lists the authorised activities and applications and permits their usage.


Black Listing
Lists the non-authorised activities and applications and prevents their usage.


Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
Data Egress monitoring and control.


</paragraph><paragraph title="7.1.7.R.05.">Automated tools are only as good as their implementation and the level of analysis they perform.&#xA0; If tools are not configured to assess all areas of potential security risk then some vulnerabilities or attacks will not be detected.&#xA0; In addition, if tools are not regularly updated, including updates for new vulnerabilities and attack methods, their effectiveness will be reduced.</paragraph><paragraph title="7.1.7.C.01." classifications="Confidential, Secret, Top Secret" compliances="Must" CID="1153">Agencies MUST develop, implement and maintain tools and procedures covering the detection of potential information security incidents, incorporating:
user awareness and training;
counter-measures against malicious code, known attack methods and types;
intrusion detection strategies;
data egress monitoring &amp; control;
access control anomalies;
audit analysis;
system integrity checking; and
vulnerability assessments.

</paragraph><paragraph title="7.1.7.C.03." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="1155">Agencies SHOULD use the results of the security risk assessment to determine the appropriate balance of resources allocated to prevention versus resources allocated to detection of information security incidents.</paragraph></block></subsection></section><section title="7.2. Reporting Information Security Incidents"><subsection title="Objective"><paragraph title="7.2.1.">To ensure reporting information security incidents is incorporated as an essential part of incident management, whether the reporting is within an agency or reports are provided to another government agency.&#xA0;</paragraph><paragraph title="7.2.2.">This assists in maintaining an accurate threat environment picture for government systems, particularly when All-of-Government (AoG) or multi-agency&#xA0;systems are involved.</paragraph></subsection><subsection title="Context"><block title="Scope"><paragraph title="7.2.3.">This section covers information relating specifically to the reporting of information security incidents.&#xA0; It does not cover the reporting of physical or personnel security incidents unless there is an impact on information systems.</paragraph><paragraph title="7.2.4.">It is important to note that, in most cases, information systems are likely to be affected.</paragraph></block><block title="Requirement for information security incident reporting"><paragraph title="7.2.5.">The requirement to report an information security incident report applies irrespective of whether incident management is internally managed or if an agency has outsourced some or all of its information technology functions and services.</paragraph><paragraph title="7.2.6.">The information security threat and intelligence landscape continues to evolve, partly &#xA0;driven by more advanced, capable, well-resourced and motivated adversaries, as well as the need to improve management and governance of information systems.&#xA0; To assist in managing these requirements, a standardised form of information exchange is essential.</paragraph><paragraph title="7.2.7.">The requirement for incident reporting has existed for many years, and guidance can be found in various standards and good practice guidance (see References at 7.2.16).</paragraph></block><block title="Historical Notes"><paragraph title="7.2.8.">While the requirement for incident reporting has been in place for many years, the reporting mechanism has changed over time:
Incident categories, incident types and resolution types were previously defined in the Incident Object Description Exchange Format (IODEF) standard.&#xA0; IODEF was an e-GIF standard.
IODEF was superseded by a group of protocols designed to automate and structure operational cybersecurity information sharing techniques on a global basis.&#xA0; International in scope and free for public use, TAXII, STIX and CybOX are community-driven technical specifications designed to enable automated information sharing.
These protocols continued to evolve with CybOX absorbed into the protocol suite and no longer separately identified.
An alternative to TAXII and STIX is VERIS ( The vocabulary for Event Recording and Incident Sharing), a set of metrics designed to provide a common language for describing security incidents in a structured and repeatable manner.
Previously New Zealand&#x2019;s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) had adopted this suite of protocols as the basis for incident reports to the NCSC and for reports issued by the NCSC.
It was found, however, that agencies were not always able to utilise these protocols and the requirement for reporting using these protocols has been withdrawn by the NCSC.
</paragraph></block><block title="Background"><paragraph title="7.2.9.">Security Incidents are frequently also termed &#x201C;a hack&#x201D;, &#x201C;a breach&#x201D;, &#x201C;a compromise&#x201D; and &#x201C;a cyber attack&#x201D;.&#xA0; The more colloquial terms may not correctly describe the nature and effect of the incident and should be used with care, if used at all.&#xA0; It is important to note that security incidents include physical incidents (such as lost documents) as well as &#x201C;cyber&#x201D; incidents.</paragraph><paragraph title="7.2.10.">The detection, recording, management and response to an incident depends primarily on effective prevention and detection mechanisms and a robust response plan.&#xA0; Effective detection and response mechanisms also provide an important record of events and assist in preventing repeat events, improving defences and streamlining response measures.</paragraph><paragraph title="7.2.11.">A key part of the detection and response is incident reporting, including internal security system reports as well as any essential external reporting.&#xA0; It is essential that response is timely and methodical in order to minimise the effects of the incident.&#xA0; In all cases it is vital that steps are taken to quickly contain the incident, minimise damage and implement measures to prevent or contain any reoccurrence.</paragraph><paragraph title="7.2.12.">Not every cybersecurity event is serious enough to warrant detailed investigation and reporting, for example a single login failure from an employee on premises.&#xA0; A persistent login failure is, however, more serious and may indicate a malicious access attempt.&#xA0; Thresholds should be established which will trigger an incident response.&#xA0; In all cases incidents should be recorded to support analysis and reporting.</paragraph></block><block title="Definition of a Cyber Security Incident"><paragraph title="7.2.13.">A cyber security incident is any event that jeopardises or may jeopardise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an information system or the information a system processes, stores, or communicates.&#xA0; This includes a violation or potential violation of security policies, security procedures, acceptable use policies or any relevant regulation or legislation.</paragraph><paragraph title="7.2.14.">It is also important to categorise incidents in order to better manage allocation of resources to the containment and remediation of the incident.&#xA0; A three-tier categorisation is suggested:
Critical: Incident affecting critical systems or information with potential to impact operations, revenue or customers.
Serious: Incident affecting noncritical systems or information, impact on operations, revenue or customers.&#xA0; Employee investigations that are time sensitive should typically be classified at this level.
Low: Possible incident affecting noncritical systems.&#xA0; Incidents or employee investigations that are not time sensitive.&#xA0; Long term investigations requiring extensive research and/or detailed forensic work.
</paragraph><paragraph title="7.2.15.">Factors that assist in determining the severity of an incident include:
Whether the incident affects a single agency or multiple agencies;
Functional impact of the incident (availability);
Information impact of the incident (confidentiality, integrity);
Recoverability from the incident;
Whether a breach of personally identifiable information (PII) held by the agency has occurred;
Reputational risk to the agency;
Impact on any MOUs, MOAs and similar formal agreements.

</paragraph></block><block title="Handling IT equipment containing media"><paragraph title="8.4.4.">During non-operational hours agencies need to store media containing classified information that resides within IT equipment in accordance with the requirements of the PSR. Agencies can comply with this requirement by undertaking one of the following processes:
ensuring IT equipment always reside in an appropriate class of secure room;
storing IT equipment during non-operational hours in an appropriate class of security container or lockable commercial cabinet;
using IT equipment with removable non-volatile media which is stored during non-operational hours in an appropriate class of security container or lockable commercial cabinet as well as securing its volatile media;
using IT equipment without non-volatile media as well as securing its volatile media;
using an encryption product to reduce the physical storage requirements of the non-volatile media as well as securing its volatile media; or
configuring IT equipment to prevent the storage of classified information on the non-volatile media when in use and enforcing scrubbing of temporary data at logoff or shutdown as well as securing its volatile media.
</paragraph><paragraph title="8.4.5.">The intent of using cryptography or preventing the storage of classified information on non-volatile media is to enable agencies to treat the media within IT equipment in accordance with the storage requirements of a lower classification, as specified in the PSR, during non-operational hours. Temporary data should be deleted at log off or shut down and volatile media secured.</paragraph><paragraph title="8.4.6.">As the process of using cryptography and preventing the storage of classified information on non-volatile media does not constitute the sanitisation and reclassification of the media, the media retains its classification for the purposes of reuse, reclassification, declassification, sanitisation, destruction and disposal requirements as specified in this manual.</paragraph></block><block title="IT equipment using hybrid hard drives or solid state drives"><paragraph title="8.4.7.">The process of preventing the storage of classified information on non-volatile media, and enforcing deletion of temporary data at logoff or shutdown, is NOT approved as a method of lowering the storage requirements, when hybrid hard drives or solid state drives are used.</paragraph></block></subsection><subsection title="Rationale &amp; Controls"><block title="8.4.8.

Infrastructure"><section title="10.1. Cable Management Fundamentals"><subsection title="Objective"><paragraph title="10.1.1.">Cable management systems are designed to support the integration of systems across government facilities, assist maintenance and engineering changes, as well as minimise the opportunity for tampering or unauthorised changes to&#xA0;cable systems.</paragraph></subsection><subsection title="Context"><block title="Scope"><paragraph title="10.1.2.">This section covers information relating to cable distribution systems used in facilities within New Zealand. When designing cable management systems, Section 10.5 - Cable Labelling and Registration and Section 10.6 - Cable Patching of this chapter also apply.</paragraph></block><block title="Applicability of controls within this section"><paragraph title="10.1.3.">The controls within this section are applicable only to communications infrastructure located within facilities in New Zealand. For deployable platforms or facilities outside of New Zealand Emanation Security Threat Assessments (Section 10.7) of this chapter of this manual MUST be consulted.</paragraph></block><block title="Common implementation scenarios"><paragraph title="10.1.4.">This section provides common requirements for non-shared facilities. Specific requirements for facilities shared between agencies and facilities shared with non-government entities can be found in subsequent sections of this chapter.</paragraph></block><block title="Red/Black Concept and Cable Separation"><paragraph title="10.1.5.">The RED/BLACK concept is the separation of electrical and electronic circuits, devices, equipment cables, connectors, components and systems that transmit store or process national security information from non-national security information. The RED/BLACK concept is sometimes described as RED/BLACK architecture or RED/BLACK engineering.</paragraph><paragraph title="10.1.6.">The RED/BLACK concept should not be confused with the generic description HIGH/LOW or HIGH SIDE/LOW SIDE.&#xA0; In this context, HIGH refers to&#xA0;systems classified CONFIDENTIAL and above and LOW refers to&#xA0;systems classified RESTRICTED and below.&#xA0; While these concepts are similar and often used interchangeably, it is important to recognise that information does not usually change classification. The signal or transmission, however, may transit both RED and BLACK systems in order to reach its intended destination. It is important to note that systems carrying a particular classification may also carry information at ALL lower classifications BUT NOT&#xA0;any higher classifications.</paragraph><paragraph title="10.1.7.">An example is the use of radio transmissions or Wi-Fi where the information may hold a HIGH classification and originate in RED equipment but once transmission occurs the signal is BLACK as radio and Wi-Fi signals can be detected by anyone within range.</paragraph><paragraph title="10.1.8.">This also leads to the situation where some equipment may have both RED and BLACK elements.&#xA0; Examples include Wi-Fi Access Points and encryption devices.&#xA0; RED Information in a BLACK environment is invariably protected by encryption and a variety of technical countermeasures.</paragraph><paragraph title="10.1.9.">All cables with metal conductors (the signal carrier, the grounding element, the strengthening member or an armoured outer covering) can act as fortuitous signal conductors allowing signals to escape or to cross-contaminate other cables and signals.&#xA0; This provides a path for the exploitation of signals, data and information.</paragraph><paragraph title="10.1.10.">A fundamental control is the separation of cables and related equipment with sufficient distance between them to prevent cross-contamination.</paragraph></block><block title="Cable trays"><paragraph title="10.1.11.">Where copper or a combination of copper and fibre cables are used, cable trays will provide separation, assist cable management and enhance cable protection.&#xA0; While preferable to separate RED cables of different&#xA0;systems for cable management purposes, the most important element is to maintain RED/BLACK separation.&#xA0;</paragraph><paragraph title="10.1.12.">It is preferable that cable trays contain dividers.&#xA0; Some cable trays provide only a single receptacle for cables (no dividers).&#xA0;If dividers are not available, multi-core fibre cables should be used.&#xA0; Cables of similar classifications should be bundled.&#xA0; A typical cable tray layout with dividers is depicted below:&#xA0;&#xA0;</paragraph></block><block title="Catenary"><paragraph title="10.1.13.">The use of catenary (wire, rope, nylon cord or similar cable support mechanisms) is becoming more widespread in place of cable trays.&#xA0; Care MUST be taken to maintain RED/BLACK separation if this method of cable support is used.</paragraph></block><block title="Earthing"><paragraph title="10.1.14.">It is important that any metal trays or metal catenary are earthed for both safety and to avoid creating any fortuitous conductors.&#xA0; All earthing points MUST be equipotentially bonded.</paragraph></block><block title="Fibre optic cabling"><paragraph title="10.1.15.">Fibre optic cabling does not produce, and is not influenced by, electromagnetic emanations; as such it offers the highest degree of protection from electromagnetic emanation effects.</paragraph><paragraph title="10.1.16.">Many more fibres can be run per cable diameter than wired cables thereby reducing cable infrastructure costs. Fibre Optic cable is usually constructed with a glass core, cladding on the core and a further, colour coded coating. Multiple cores can be bundled into a single cable and multiple cables can be bundled into a high capacity cable. This is illustrated in Figures 1 below. Cables also have a central strength member of mylar or some similar high strength, non-conductive material</paragraph><paragraph title="10.1.17.">Fibre cable is considered the best method to future proof against unforeseen threats.</paragraph><paragraph title="10.1.18.">Cable trays for fibre only cable may be of any suitable material.&#xA0; If metal trays are used they MUST be earthed.</paragraph></block><block title="Ribbon Fibre Optic Cable"><paragraph title="10.1.19.">In the context of this discussion, traditional and ribbon fibre optic cables are subject to identical controls, restrictions in installation and use and any operational caveats.</paragraph><paragraph title="10.1.20.">Unlike traditional beam optical cable, ribbon fibre optic cable is arranged into a strip.&#xA0; Because the ribbon contains only coated optical fibres, this type of cable takes up much less space and is generally lighter (weight) than individually buffered optical fibres.&#xA0; As a result, ribbon cables are denser than any other fibre cable design.&#xA0; They are ideal for applications where space is limited, such as in an existing conduit that has very little room left for an additional cable.&#xA0; Ribbon fibre optic cable is a convenient solution for space and weight challenges.&#xA0;Figure 2: Typical Ribbon Cable</paragraph><paragraph title="10.1.21.">Ribbon cables enable the migration to high fibre count systems required to support high bandwidth applications including 10, 40 and 100Gb/s.&#xA0; Ribbon cables are rarely used in long distance fibre optic trunk cable but are typically used in data centres, campus, commercial buildings and large industrial sites.&#xA0; Fibre counts can range from 2 to over 1700.</paragraph><paragraph title="10.1.22.">The cable ribbons are coated optical fibres placed side by side, encapsulated in Mylar tape, similar to a miniature version of wire ribbons used in computer wiring.&#xA0; A single ribbon many contain 4, 8, 12 or 24 optical fibres with ribbons stacked up to 22 high.&#xA0; At present 12-fiber ribbons are readily accessible and identifiable with ribbon identification numbers, TIA-598 compliant fibre colour coding and are available with non-flame-retardant or formulated flame-retardant outer jacket.&#xA0; They are also available in several configurations including all-dielectric, armoured and aerial self-supporting cables.</paragraph><paragraph title="10.1.23.">Because the cable profile is different to older round cable type, new cable strippers, cleavers, and fusion splicers are required for installation and maintenance.</paragraph><paragraph title="10.1.24.">Fibre optic ribbon cable comes in two basic configurations: loose tube ribbon cable and jacket ribbon.&#xA0; Loose tube cables are where fibre ribbons are stacked on top of one another inside a loose-buffered tube.&#xA0; This arrangement can hold several hundred fibres in close quarters. The buffer, strength members, and cable jacket carry any strain while the fibre ribbons move freely inside the buffer tube.</paragraph><paragraph title="10.1.25.">Jacket ribbon cable is similar to a regular tight-buffered cable, but it is elongated to contain a fibre ribbon. This type of cable typically features a small amount of strength member and a ripcord to tear through the jacket.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Figure 3: Jacket Cable&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Figure 4: Loose Tube Cable</paragraph><paragraph title="10.1.26.">Infrastructure cables contain multiple fibre ribbon units inside a central tube with dielectric strength members for tensile strength and colour coded fibres with individual ribbon unit ID numbers for clear identification.&#xA0; Ribbon fibre optic cables are available in configurations supporting high-speed, applications such as Gigabit Ethernet, 10 Gigabit Ethernet, Gigabit ATM and Fibre Channel.&#xA0;Figure 5: Infrastructure (High Cable Count) Ribbon Cable</paragraph></block><block title="Armoured Fibre optic cabling"><paragraph title="10.1.27.">Some fibre optic cable also includes conductive metal cable strengtheners and conductive metal armoured sheaths which may be wire-wound or stainless steel mesh for external cable protection and steel wire cores as core strength members. This strengthening and armouring is conductive and specialist advice may be needed to avoid earth loops, cross-coupling, inductive coupling or the introduction of other compromising signals and currents. Fibre optic cable with metal cable strengtheners or conductive armoured sheaths is considered unsuitable for secure installations.&#xA0; &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Figure 6 - Armoured Ribbon Fibre Cable&#xA0;</paragraph></block><block title="Backbone"><paragraph title="10.1.28.">A backbone or core is the central cabling that connects the infrastructure (servers, databases, gateways, equipment and telecommunication rooms etc.) to local areas networks, workstations and other devices, such as MFD&#x2019;s. Smaller networks may also be connected to the backbone.</paragraph><paragraph title="10.1.29.">A backbone can span a geographic area of any size including an office, a single building, multi-story buildings, campus, national and international infrastructure. In the context of the NZISM the term backbone generally refers to the central cabling within a building or a campus.</paragraph><paragraph title="10.1.30.">Backbones can be defined in terms of six criteria:
transmission media;
topology;
security required;
access control;
transmission technique;&#xA0;
transmission speed and capability.
</paragraph></block><block title="TOP SECRET cabling"><paragraph title="10.1.31.">For TOP SECRET cabling the cable&#x2019;s non-conductive protective sheath IS NOT considered to be a conduit. For TOP SECRET fibre optic cables with sub-units, the cable&#x2019;s outer protective sheath IS considered to be a conduit.</paragraph></block><block title="Power Filters"><paragraph title="10.1.32.">A power filter is a device placed between an external power source and electronic devices.&#xA0; It is used in order to attenuate external transients, conducted radio frequencies (RF) or electromagnetic interference (EMI) between the AC or DC power line and the equipment.&#xA0; Filters can also reduce radiated interference to assist in managing emissions or susceptibility to interference.</paragraph><paragraph title="10.1.33.">The power lines entering an electronic device can act both as an antenna and as a low impedance conduction path for signals that exist inside the device.&#xA0; These signals may couple into the power line, either through inductance or capacitance, from internal circuitry, other internal wiring or from other components such as transformers, coils or adjacently routed wires.&#xA0; To a lesser degree, but still problematic, the power lines can also pickup induced current signals from magnetic fields inside the enclosure.</paragraph><paragraph title="10.1.34.">The purpose of power supply filters is to smooth the power supply and provide a degree of isolation from the external power supply for connected electronic devices.&#xA0; RF/EMI filters are designed to reduce line - to - ground (common mode) interference, EMI and anomalous RF.&#xA0; Best practice is to solve or suppress EMI and RF emissions at source, rather than after emission.</paragraph><paragraph title="10.1.35.">There are international and national regulations on frequencies and signal levels that a device is permitted to produce in order to minimise or prevent interference with other equipment.&#xA0; Practically no modern equipment, with fast digital circuits and switch-mode power supply regulators can meet electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) requirements without efficient filtering, particularly when operating in close proximity. &#xA0;While most devices are designed by manufacturers to meet regulation, not all devices filter EMI or RF to levels acceptable for secure environments.&#xA0; It may be necessary to use a power line filter to keep signals inside the enclosure as much as possible and keep any generated signals to less than the legal or required limits for conducted emissions.</paragraph><paragraph title="10.1.36.">Power filters have a variety of capabilities depending on their specification.&#xA0; It is important the filters are selected correctly for the power supply, expected load and required attenuation capacity. It is important to note that an Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) is NOT considered an RF/EMI filter.</paragraph><paragraph title="10.1.37.">Common usage of filters is for computer systems, laboratory and testing equipment, medical devices, consumer electronics, and to protect any equipment where good quality power supply and protection of the electronic devices and data is required.&#xA0; Devices can be within buildings, vehicle, ships, aircraft or portable.</paragraph><paragraph title="10.1.38.">Power filters often include EMC/ RFI filters which channel emissions to earth to prevent them from being conducted back down the supply cables.&#xA0; This can be detected as an earth leakage current which may cause Residual Current Devices (RCDs) to trip.&#xA0; This problem can be corrected by using the correct specification of power filter or installing low leakage current devices.&#xA0; Agencies should consult the GCSB if such problems occur.</paragraph></block></subsection><subsection title="References"><paragraph title="10.1.39.">Fibre Standards:

Accidently not being able to locate end points of network and patch cables without tracing the cable end to end.
Physically impeding access to equipment.
Positioning of equipment and cables such that airflow (cooling) is impeded.&#xA0; As the density of equipment in racks increases, cooling becomes an increasingly important factor.&#xA0; Poor rack design combined with dense rack utilization can contribute to internal rack temperatures significantly higher than ambient room temperatures.

Cables should be no longer than required to avoid overlength cables compromising separation.</paragraph></block><block title="Access to BLACK equipment and components by uncleared staff and contractors"><paragraph title="10.6.20.">In some instances there may be a requirement for external technical or other uncleared personnel to access BLACK equipment and components for servicing, repair or replacement.&#xA0; Care must be taken to maintain the integrity of RED equipment and components.&#xA0; This can be especially problematic in shared rack configurations as described above.This requirement should be identified before installation takes place and segregation measures implemented.&#xA0; Ideally physical separation of BLACK from RED is the best solution, recognising however, this may not always be possible or practical. Other solutions may include, for example, a shared rack that has two doors with the RED door locked and alarmed so that BLACK equipment can be accessed without compromising the security of RED equipment.&#xA0; Discussion with the GCSB may identify other practical solutions.</paragraph></block></subsection><subsection title="References"><paragraph title="10.6.21.">Further References avaliable below:

Network Design, Architecture and IP Address Management"><subsection title="Objective"><paragraph title="10.8.1.">IP Address architecture, allocation and addressing schemes enable and support system security and data protection.</paragraph></subsection><subsection title="Context"><block title="Scope"><paragraph title="10.8.2.">This section includes discussion of the principles of separation and segregation as network design and network architecture characteristics. &#xA0;It also discusses how IP addresses can be used to support these principles for improved security of larger or multi-classification agency systems.</paragraph></block><block title="Background"><paragraph title="10.8.3.">The larger the network, the more difficult it is to protect. &#xA0;A large, unsegmented network presents a large attack surface with greater susceptibility to the rapid spread and dissemination of system faults, weaknesses, vulnerabilities and attacks. &#xA0;In a non-segmented network, traffic and applications generally have access to the entire network. If a fault occurs or an attacker gains entry, the fault or attacker can move laterally through the network causing disruption, network outages and enabling access to critical operational or classified data.</paragraph><paragraph title="10.8.4.">A large network is also more difficult to monitor and control. &#xA0;Segmenting the network limits an attacker&#x2019;s ability to move through the network by preventing lateral movement between zones. &#xA0;Segmentation also enhances the ability to detect, monitor, control, isolate and correct faults.</paragraph><paragraph title="10.8.5.">A fundamental construct in the management of risk in networks is that of Trust Zones and Trust Boundaries. &#xA0;A Trust Zone is a zoning construct based on levels of trust, classification, information asset value and essential information security. &#xA0;A Trust Boundary is the interface between two or more Trust Zones. Trust Zones use the principles of separation and segregation to manage sensitive information assets and ensure security policies are consistently applied to all assets in a particular Trust Zone. &#xA0;Refer also to Section 22.1 &#x2013; Cloud Computing and Section 22.2 &#x2013; Virtualisation.</paragraph></block><block title="Separation and Segregation"><paragraph title="10.8.6.">Separation and Segregation are determined by system function and the sensitivity of the data the system stores, processes and transmits. &#xA0;One common example is placing systems that require a connection to the Internet into a demilitarized zone (DMZ) that is separated and segregated (isolated) from more sensitive systems. Another example is the use of compartments.</paragraph><paragraph title="10.8.7.">Separation and Segregation limits the ability of an intruder to exploit a vulnerability with the intent of elevating privileges to gain access to more sensitive systems on the internal network. &#xA0;VLANs may be used to further separate systems by controlling access and providing segregation thus giving additional protection.</paragraph><paragraph title="10.8.8.">Network segmentation is an effective strategy for protecting access to key data assets, and impeding the lateral movement of system faults, threats and malicious activity. &#xA0;Segregation has the following benefits:
Enhanced performance: with fewer hosts per subnet, there is a reduced signalling and traffic overhead allowing more bandwidth for data communication.
Improved security: with less signalling traffic going through all network segments, it is more difficult for an attacker to analyse the addressing scheme and network structure. &#xA0;Failures in one segment are less likely to propagate and more robust access control can be established and enforced.
</paragraph><paragraph title="10.8.9.">Effective segregation also requires:
Specialised knowledge: networks may support many devices with complex policies and rule sets. &#xA0;Support staff must be properly educated and trained to ensure the network segmentation is maintained.
Administrative effort: changes in infrastructure, such as new applications and new technologies, can extend the time required to make changes and ensure the integrity of network segments.
Infrastructure Investment: segregation may require more equipment, new equipment with advanced functionalities, or specific software to deal with multiple segments. &#xA0;These requirements should be considered during budget planning.
</paragraph></block><block title="ISO 27001 and ISO 27002 implementation recommendations for network segregation"><paragraph title="10.8.10.">These ISO Standards require the implementation of network segregation. &#xA0;In particular they recommend that groups of information services, users, and information systems are segregated on networks. &#xA0;Specific recommendations are summarised below:
Divide large networks into separate network domains (segments);
Consider physical and logical segregation;
Define domain perimeters;
Define traffic rules between domains;
Use authentication, encryption, and user-level network access control technologies;
Consider integration of the organisation&#x2019;s network and segments with those of business partners.
</paragraph><paragraph title="10.8.11.">The following structures and techniques should be considered:
Criteria-based segmentation: Pre-define rules to establish perimeters and create new segments in order to reduce unnecessary redesign and future administrative overheads. &#xA0;Examples of criteria are trust level (e.g., external public segment, staff segment, server segment, database segment, suppliers segment, etc.), organisational unit (e.g., Operations, Service Desk, Outreach, etc.), and combinations (e.g., external public access).
Use of physical and logical segmentation: Depending upon the risk level identified in the risk assessment, it may be necessary to use physically separated infrastructures to protect the organisation&#x2019;s information and assets (e.g., classified data flowing through a dedicated fibre), or you may use solutions based on logical segmentation like Virtual Private Network (VPN).
Access rules for traffic flowing: Traffic between segments, including those of permitted external parties, should be controlled according to the need to access information. &#xA0;Gateways should be configured based on information classification and risk assessment. A specific case of access control applies to wireless networks, since they have poor perimeter definition. &#xA0;The recommendation is to treat wireless communication as an external connection until the traffic can reach a proper wired gateway before granting access to internal network segments. Refer also to Chapter 19 &#x2013; Gateway Security.

</paragraph></block><block title="Classification"><paragraph title="10.8.14.">Classified systems should, by definition, be segregated. &#xA0;This is particularly important where network elements have access to compartments and compartmented data.</paragraph><paragraph title="10.8.15.">Ideally compartmented elements of systems should be segregated and separated from the main network. &#xA0;This may include the use of a reserved address space, monitored to detect violations or unauthorised attempts to connect to compartments or to access compartmented data.</paragraph></block><block title="Security Zones"><paragraph title="10.8.16.">A security zone is a group of one or more physical or virtual firewall interfaces and the network segments connected to the zone&#x2019;s interfaces. &#xA0;Protection for each zone is individually specified and controlled so that each zone receives the specific protections it requires according to classification, endorsement, compartment and sensitivity of data.</paragraph></block><block title="IP Address Management"><paragraph title="10.8.17.">The fundamental goal of an IP addressing scheme is to ensure network devices are uniquely addressed. &#xA0;IP Address Schemes are a fundamental part of any network&#x2019;s security architecture and should support network separation and segregation. &#xA0;There are a number of techniques to assist in separating and segregating network elements. It is also useful to consider how to segregate and control network traffic through:
Defined network perimeters and boundaries; and
Defined network traffic rules.
</paragraph><paragraph title="10.8.18.">A well-structured IP addressing scheme promotes the ability to quickly identify node properties from an IP address which assist in network management and fault finding and rectification.</paragraph></block><block title="Address Block Allocation"><paragraph title="10.8.19.">There are two main difficulties when assigning address blocks for types of devices. &#xA0;First is that over time there is insufficient provision for additional devices and network growth. &#xA0;When the allocated address block is exhausted, the addressing scheme is compromised (broken). The second is that you have a small number of devices in an address block, but are running out of addresses in other parts of the network. &#xA0;If you &#x201C;borrow&#x201D; from a pre-assigned address range, the addressing scheme is also compromised.</paragraph><paragraph title="10.8.20.">Internal IP address ranges are defined by the IETF. &#xA0;Commonly known as RFC 1918 addresses, the most recent RFC is 6761. &#xA0;These RFC&#x2019;s define private IP address ranges which cannot be used for external (Internet) IP addressing. &#xA0;Three address ranges (blocks) are defined:


IPv4 Address Range
Network IPv4 address Block
Directed Broadcast IPv4 address
IPv4 Addresses


10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255
10.0.0.0/8
10.255.255.255
16,777,216 


172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255
172.16.0.0/12
172.31.255.255
1,048,576


192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255

</paragraph><paragraph title="10.8.21.">IPv4 addresses are 32-bit binary addresses, divided into 4-Octets and normally represented in a decimal format. &#xA0;An example of IPv4 address is 192.168.100.10.&#xA0; IPv6 addresses are so much larger than IPv4 addresses and impractical to clearly represent in decimals. &#xA0;IPv6 addresses are usually represented in hexadecimal numbers, separated by a colon. &#xA0;An example of an IPv6 address is 2001:0DB8:0000:0002:0022:2217:FF3B:118C. &#xA0;Private IPv6 addresses are specified in RFC 4193</paragraph><paragraph title="10.8.22.">Private addressing is a means of distinguishing networks, assisting in separation and segregation.</paragraph></block><block title="Private use of reserved addresses"><paragraph title="10.8.23.">Some IP addresses have been reserved in IETF standards. &#xA0;Despite official warnings, some organisations use parts of the reserved IP address space for their internal networks where address space is exhausted or poorly designed. &#xA0;This creates conflicts with devices and signalling traffic protocols which can create network faults, anomalies and network outages. This practice is strongly discouraged.</paragraph></block><block title="Devices which have default IP addresses"><paragraph title="10.8.24.">Some devices are supplied with default IP addresses. &#xA0;If using the IETF RFC 1918 addressing protocol (e.g. 10.0.x.x) some devices may have been allocated the same (duplicate) IP address.</paragraph><paragraph title="10.8.25.">It is important to change default addresses to new addresses that conform with the addressing scheme selected for the agency.</paragraph></block><block title="DHCP"><paragraph title="10.8.26.">In theory, there is only one network device that absolutely needs a true static address, the DHCP server. &#xA0;In practice, it is preferable to assign address blocks to major groups of devices for control, fault isolation and security purposes. &#xA0;Traditionally static devices are provided with a reserved address. These devices may include:
DCHP Server;
Gateway devices;
Firewalls;
Routers; and
Switches.
</paragraph><paragraph title="10.8.27.">The majority of other devices can be allocated a DHCP address.</paragraph><paragraph title="10.8.28.">It is important to identify the essential device groups using a risk assessment, operational characteristics, level of security, system classification and other relevant architectural features, business requirements and operational constraints.</paragraph></block><block title="Connector Types and Cable Colours"><paragraph title="10.8.29.">Cable management is discussed in detail earlier in this chapter. &#xA0;In particular note the discussion (10.1.4) of Red/Black concepts which includes separation of electrical and electronic circuits, devices, equipment cables, connectors and systems that transmit store or process national security information (Red) from non-national security information (Black)</paragraph><paragraph title="10.8.30.">Wherever practical and possible, connectors for systems of different classifications should be distinct and be selected to avoid accidental cross-connection of systems of different classifications. &#xA0;This can be achieved through the use of colour and keyed connectors where the colour and keying is different for each classification level or compartment (refer also to 10.1.30&#xA0;and 10.6.6).</paragraph></block><block title="Central Information Repository"><paragraph title="10.8.31.">Creating a central repository of all the information on networks, IP addresses and devices, is critical to maintaining control of the network. &#xA0;The challenge with traditional tools is that there are often specific tools for each category of devices: one system to track virtual machines, one system to track wireless users, one system to track Windows servers, one system to track Linux machines, etc.</paragraph><paragraph title="10.8.32.">A single repository where all the data relevant to networks, hosts, servers, dynamic clients, and virtual environments can be tracked and synchronised is essential for larger networks. &#xA0;The ability to search across all this information will enable network teams to quickly track changing network landscapes and rapidly troubleshoot issues as they arise. In addition, business data related to a network resource helps bind together the logical network construct and the reality of IT resources.</paragraph></block></subsection><subsection title="References"><paragraph title="10.8.33.">Further references can be found at:

Radio Frequency Identification Devices "><subsection title="Objective"><paragraph title="11.6.1.">To ensure Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) devices are used safely and securely in order to protect privacy, prevent unauthorised access and to prevent the compromise of secure spaces.</paragraph></subsection><subsection title="Context"><block title="Scope "><paragraph title="11.6.2.">This section provides information relating to the risks, security and secure use of RFID devices. Access Control Systems incorporating RFID or smart cards are discussed in more detail in Section 11.7 - Access Control Systems.</paragraph></block><block title="Background"><paragraph title="11.6.3.">This section contains a short description of the history, formats, operating frequencies, risks, controls and countermeasures related to the use of RFID.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.6.4.">In practical use since the 1970&#x2019;s, RFID is now widely used for product identification, stock control, as anti-theft in manufacturing and retail organisations, payment cards (smart ATM and paywave cards) and access control systems. They are useful tools in improving logistics, profoundly changing cost structures for business, and improving levels of safety and authenticity in a wide range of applications such as access control, passports, payment cards, vehicle immobilisers, toll roads, pharmaceuticals tracking, management of high value items and weapons control. RFID tags are now produced in a wide variety of types and sizes, from the size of a grain of rice or printed on paper to much larger devices incorporating a battery or other power supply.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.6.5.">Unlike bar coding systems, RFID devices can communicate without requiring line of sight and over distances ranging from a few centimetres to kilometres. They can be equipped with sensors to collect data on temperature changes, sudden shocks, humidity or other factors affecting product safety and quality.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.6.6.">RFID devices typically use radio signals to transmit identifying information such as product or serial numbers, manufacture date, origin and batch number. This identifying information is invariably in the form of an Electronic Product Code (EPC) following the standards and conventions published by GS1. GS1 is a global group that also develops standards for other identifiers such as barcodes. The GS1 standards and conventions are now incorporated into ISO standards, see references table&#xA0;at 11.6.55.</paragraph></block><block title="Basic Formats"><paragraph title="11.6.7.">The basic format of an Electronic Product Code (EPC) is illustrated below:</paragraph><paragraph title="11.6.8.">RFID devices are often referred to as &#x201C;tags&#x201D;. Passive tags are unpowered and harvest power from the RFID reader. Active tags incorporate a power supply, usually a battery. Tags are produced in Classes 0 to 5 and are now generally produced to Generation 2 specifications. The EPCGen2 standard for Class 1 tags focuses on reliability and efficiency but supports only very basic security. Features of the Gen 2 specification include:
a 96 bit EPC number with read/write capability and can be designated used for other data ;
a 32/64 bit tag identifier (TID) &#x2013; identifies the manufacturer of the tag, also with read/write capabilities;&#xA0;
32 bit kill password to permanently disable the tag;&#xA0;
32 bit access password to lock the read/write characteristics of the tag and also set the tag for disabling ;
User memory &#x2013; dependant on the manufacturer and can be as little as 0 bits to 2048 bits. Larger user memory is in development.
</paragraph><paragraph title="11.6.9.">The distance from which a tag can be read is termed the read range. A read range will depend on a number of factors, including the radio frequency used for reader/tag/reader communication, the size and orientation of the antennae, the power output of the reader, and whether the tags have a battery or other power supply. Battery-powered tags typically have a read range of 100 meters (approximately 300 feet) although this can extend to kilometres under favourable conditions. It is possible that powered RFID tags, typically used on cargo containers, railway wagons, vehicles and other large assets, could be read from a satellite if there is little background &#x201C;noise&#x201D; and the broadcast signal is sufficiently powerful.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.6.10.">RFID tags are divided into classes 0 to 5:


Class
Description


0
Read only, passive tags


1
Write once passive tags. &#xA0;128-bit memory.


2
Read/Write with up to 65Kb read/write memory and authenticated access control. &#xA0;Can monitor temperature, pressure, vibration.


3
Semi-Passive. Own power source but cannot initiate communication. &#xA0;Remains passive until activated by a reader. &#xA0;Up to 65 Kb read/write memory and integrated sensor circuitry.


4
Active tags (own power source) with integrated transmitter. &#xA0;Can communicate with readers and other tags operating in the same RF band. &#xA0;Rewritable memory and ad hoc networking capability. &#xA0;Read range &gt;100 metres (approx. 300&#x2019;).


5
Reader tags, can power class 1 to 3 tags and communicate with all classes. &#xA0;Includes all the capabilities of class 4 tags.


</paragraph></block><block title="Operating Frequencies"><paragraph title="11.6.11.">RFID operates in several parts of the Radio Spectrum. Not all frequencies are authorised for use in all countries and will depend on the radio spectrum allocation authority in each country. It is important to note, however, that some RFID tags designed to operate at frequencies not used in the importing country may be attached to imported goods. This can represent a risk from scanning at frequencies not authorised or normally monitored in the importing country.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.6.12.">Depending on the design and intended application, RFID tag can operate at different frequencies. It is important to note that longer range RFID tags operate at frequencies close to or within allocated Wi-Fi frequencies. Allocated frequencies are:


Band
Frequency

Typical Range



LF
125-134.2 kHz and 140-148.5 kHz&#xA0;

Up to 1/2 metre



HF

13.553 - 13.567 MHz and 26.957 - 27.283 MHz


Up to 1 metre



UHF

433 MHz, 858 - 930 MHz, 2.400 - 2.483 GHz, 2.446 - 2.454GHz


1 to 10 metres



SHF

5.725 - 5.875 GHz


&gt; 100 metres



</paragraph><paragraph title="11.6.13.">As RFID devices are deployed in more sophisticated applications such as matching hospital patients with laboratory test results or tracking systems for dangerous materials, concerns have been raised about protecting such systems against eavesdropping, unauthorised uses and privacy breaches.</paragraph></block><block title="Smart Cards"><paragraph title="11.6.14.">Smart cards typically comprise an embedded integrated circuit incorporating a microchip with internal memory, a read-only CSN (Card Serial Number) or a UID (User Identification). The card connects to a reader with direct physical contact or a contactless radio frequency (RFID) interface. With an embedded microchip, smart cards can store large amounts of data, carry out on-card functions (such as encryption and authentication) and interact intelligently with a smart card reader. Smart card technology can be found in a variety of form factors, including plastic cards, key fobs, watches, subscriber identification modules used in mobile phones, and USB-based tokens. Smart cards are widely used in payment card (debit and credit cards and electronic wallets) and access control systems.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.6.15.">The ISO/IEC 14443&#xA0;standard for contactless smart card communications defines two types of contactless cards ("A" and "B") and allows for communications at distances up to 10 cm operating at 13.56 MHz. The alternative ISO/IEC 15693 standard allows communications at distances up to 50 cm. The ISO/IEC 7816 standard (in 15 parts) defines the physical, electrical interface and operating characteristics of these cards.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.6.16.">In common with other RFID devices, smart cards incorporate an antenna embedded in the body of the card (or key fob, watch or token). When the card is brought within range of the reader, the chip in the card is powered on. Once powered on, an RF communication protocol is initiated and communication established between the card and the reader for data transfer.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.6.17.">Smart cards typically incorporate protective mechanisms including authentication, secure data storage, encryption, tamper-resistance and secure communication. Support for biometric authentication may also be incorporated.</paragraph></block></subsection><subsection title="Threats and Vulnerabilities"><block title="Attack Vectors"><paragraph title="11.6.20.">Attack vectors for RFID devices include:
interception of legitimate transmissions (man-in-the-middle [MITM] attacks);
interception of authorised reader data by an unauthorised device;
unauthorised access to tags and readers;
rogue/cloned tags;
rogue and unauthorised RFID readers;&#xA0;
side-channel attacks (timing measurements, electromagnetic radiations etc.);&#xA0;
attacks on back-end systems;
jamming of legitimate signals.
</paragraph><paragraph title="11.6.21.">Because RFID devices incorporate antennas, there is a possibility of radiation hazards from high &#x2013;powered devices, particularly active tags and readers. It is important to note however that these cases are rare, occur in high powered devices only and that the vast majority of RFID devices do not pose radiation hazards. Related hazards include electromagnetic radiation hazards to personnel (HERP), fuel (HERF) and ordnance (HERO).</paragraph><paragraph title="11.6.22.">Threats and Vulnerabilities of RFID systems are summarised in the table below:

</paragraph><paragraph title="11.6.23.">It is important to note that attacks are often used in combination creating blended attacks. Blended attacks may be a combination of attack types, use of multiple attack vectors, the targeting of individual sub-systems or combinations of all three elements.</paragraph></block></subsection><subsection title="Good Practices and Countermeasures"><block title="Authentication"><paragraph title="11.6.25.">By design and usage, RFID technologies are item, product or shipment identification but not authentication technologies. Authentication of a reader or tag requires a common secret (key) shared when establishing communication, and before data is exchanged. Currently, only RFID tags with microprocessors have sufficient computation resources to use authentication techniques. These can be found in such applications as e-passports, or payment or ticketing applications (public transport, for example).</paragraph><paragraph title="11.6.26.">With a challenge/response authentication mechanism the reader issues an enquiry to the tag which results in a response. The secret tag information is computed information from internal cryptographic algorithms by both the tag and reader and the results are sent. Correct responses are required for a successful information exchange. The system is essentially the same as encrypting data over a standard radio link.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.6.27.">The ISO/JTC1/SC31 committee is in the process of establishing new standards to support the use of simple RFID authentication and encryption protocols.</paragraph></block><block title="Keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code (HMAC)"><paragraph title="11.6.28.">HMAC is a protocol where both an RFID reader and RFID tag share a common secret key that can be used in combination with a hash algorithm to provide one-way or mutual authentication between tag and reader. When HMAC is applied to messages, it also assures the integrity of data in the messages.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.6.29.">HMAC is not specified in any RFID standard, but the capability is generally available in vendor products. HMAC is often used where the risk of eavesdropping is high and passwords alone are considered to offer an inadequate authentication mechanism. This will be determined by the risk assessment. HMAC is also used where applications require evidence of a tag&#x2019;s authenticity.</paragraph></block><block title="Digital Signatures"><paragraph title="11.6.30.">Digital signatures are compatible with existing RFID tag standards. In authenticated RFID systems, tags can receive, store, and transmit digital signatures with existing read and write commands because the complexity is managed by readers or back-end systems. However, the use of digital signatures to support authentication of readers to tags would require tags to support relatively complex cryptographic functions, beyond the capacity of common tag designs.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.6.31.">In addition, digital signatures that are not generated by the tag itself are subject to replay attacks. An adversary could query a tag to obtain its evidence of authenticity (i.e., the digital signature created by a previous reader) and then replicate that data on a cloned tag. Consequently, password or symmetric key authentication systems likely will support tag access control, as opposed to tag authenticity verification, for the immediate future.</paragraph></block><block title="Encryption"><paragraph title="11.6.32.">Data stored in the memory of an RFID tag is intended to be freely shared with the various tag users (manufacturers, stock controllers, shipping agents, etc.). Only an RFID reader is required to access the data which raises the question of data security. Memory and computational power of an RFID tag is limited, but data elements can be password-protected or reserved for nominated usage. Several levels of authorisation (read-only, read and write, delete, etc.) can be determined. It is also advisable to encrypt the data entered onto the tag, the encryption/decryption taking place at the RFID reader or back-end system.</paragraph></block><block title="Cover-Coding"><paragraph title="11.6.33.">Cover-coding is a method of hiding information from eavesdroppers. In the EPCglobal Class-1 Generation-2 standard, cover-coding is used to obscure passwords and information written to a tag using the write command. Some proprietary technologies also support similar features. Cover-coding is an example of minimalist cryptography because it operates within the challenging power and memory constraints of passive RFID tags.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.6.34.">Cover-coding is a useful mitigation where eavesdropping is a risk, but adversaries are expected to be at a greater distance from the tags than readers. Cover-coding helps prevent the execution of unauthorised commands that could disable a tag or modify the tag&#x2019;s data. Cover-coding mitigates business process, business intelligence, and privacy risks.</paragraph></block><block title="Rolling Code"><paragraph title="11.6.35.">A rolling code approach is a scheme where the identifier given by the RFID tag changes after each read action. It requires the RFID reader and RFID tag to use identical algorithms. If multiple readers are used, they must be linked so that tracking of code changes can be monitored. This scheme reduces the usefulness of any responses that may be observed unless the pattern of change can be detected or deduced.</paragraph></block></subsection><subsection title="Other Defensive Measures"><block title="Shielding"><paragraph title="11.6.37.">RF shielding is designed to limit the propagation of RF signals outside of the shielded area. Shielding helps to prevent unauthorised reading, access to or modification of the RFID tag data or interfering with RFID readers. Shielding can be applied to small, individual items, such as passports and credit cards or to large elements such as shipping containers.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.6.38.">Shielding is also important where interference is present or detected. This may be caused by environmental conditions, such as operating in a port area, or by deliberate attempts to access readers or tags.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.6.39.">Engineering assessments will determine the requirement for shielding from adverse environmental conditions and the risk assessment will determine the likelihood and threat from unauthorised and deliberate attempts to access readers, tags and data.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.6.40.">RFID blocking wallets and RFID card sleeves are available to block RFID frequencies. These are typically used for credit and other payment, access and transit cards and e-passports, as a countermeasure for skimming attacks or unauthorised tracking.</paragraph></block><block title="Blocker Tags"><paragraph title="11.6.41.">A special tag, called a &#x201C;blocker&#x201D; tag, blocks an RFID reader by simultaneously answering with 0 and 1 to every reader&#x2019;s request during the identification protocol. The reader is then incapable of distinguishing individual tags. The blocker tag may block a reader universally or within ranges.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.6.42.">This furnishes privacy by shielding consumers from the unwanted scanning of RFID tags that they may carry or wear. It also protects against unauthorised readers and eavesdroppers. The blocker tag is an alternative to more simple solutions such as the kill command, shielding and active jamming. It is important to note that active jamming may be illegal (see 11.6.53).</paragraph><paragraph title="11.6.43.">Blocker tags can also implement one or more privacy policies and multiple blocker tags may cover multiple zones.&#xA0; The blocker tag has a very low-cost of implementation and standard tags need no modification and little support for password-protected bit flipping.&#xA0; A threat is that blocker tags can be used to mount DoS attacks in which a malicious blocker tag universally blocks readers.</paragraph></block><block title="Tag &#x201C;Kill&#x201D; Command "><paragraph title="11.6.44.">The &#x201C;kill&#x201D; command is a password-protected command specified in the EPC Gen-1 and EPC Gen-2 standards intended to make a tag non-operational. A typical application is anti-theft where the kill command is activated at a point-of-sale terminal, after goods have been paid for. Kill commands can be password protected.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.6.45.">Kill commands function by fusing a ROM component or antenna connection by applying a large amount of power to the tag at the point of sale reader/terminal. It is important to note that the antenna deactivation method does not completely kill the tag but rather disable its RF interface. Once in the disabled state, the tag still retains data and can still function.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.6.46.">The kill feature can represent a threat to an RFID system if the password is compromised. This risk is particularly apparent where the same password is used for multiple tags. If a weak (e.g., short or easily guessed) password is assigned to the kill command, tags can be disabled at will. Also important is the longer a tag uses the same password, the more likely it is that the password will be compromised.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.6.47.">Data stored on the tag is still present in the tag&#x2019;s memory after it is disabled (although it can no longer be accessed wirelessly), and, therefore, still may be accessible with physical access to the tag.</paragraph></block><block title="Tamper Resistance"><paragraph title="11.6.48.">Some RFID tags are designed with tamper resistant or tamper-evident features to help prevent unauthorised alteration of removal of tags from the objects to which they are attached. A simple type of tamper resistance is the use of a frangible, or easily broken, antenna. If this tag is removed, the connection with the antenna is severed, rendering the tag inoperable. Other, more complex types of RFID systems monitor the integrity of objects associated with the tags to ensure that the objects have not been compromised, altered, or subjected to extreme conditions.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.6.49.">Simple forms of tamper resistance may leave data intact and subject to the same threats described above. In addition it is possible to circumvent tamper resistance mechanisms by repairing a frangible antenna. It is important to note that tamper-resistance and tamper-evidence technologies do not prevent the theft or destruction of the tag or its associated items.</paragraph></block><block title="Temporary Deactivation"><paragraph title="11.6.50.">Some tags allow the RF interface to be temporarily deactivated.&#xA0; Methods vary amongst manufacturers with some methods requiring physical intervention.&#xA0; Typically tags would be activated inside a designated area and deactivated when shipped, preventing eavesdropping or other unauthorised transactions during shipment.&#xA0; When the tags arrive at their destination, they can be reactivated, for example for inventory management.&#xA0; Conversely, tags can be used for tracking during shipment and may be deactivated on delivery.</paragraph></block></subsection><subsection title="RFID Risks and Controls Summary"><paragraph title="11.6.51.">A summary of RFID Risks and Controls is presented in the Table below:

</paragraph></subsection><subsection title="Rationale &amp; Controls"><block title="11.6.59. Risk Assessment"><paragraph title="11.6.59.R.01.">As with many technologies, adoption of RFID has the potential to introduce a wide range of risks in addition to the risks that already exist for agency systems. This may include privacy risks, depending on the use, information held and implementation of the RFID system. A risk assessment is an essential tool in determining and assessing the range and extent of risk and threat in the use of RFID devices.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.6.59.R.02.">Risks to RFID system vary according to the technology used, system engineering, the systems architecture, application, context and deployment scenario. A holistic approach to risk at each stage of the system life cycle and each for system component is essential if a robust security strategy is to be developed.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.6.59.R.03.">The identification of classes of tags is fundamental to managing the risks of RFID devices in secure spaces. Classes 0 and 1 pose little risk. Other classes of tag (2 to 5), however, have limited data storage capability and active tags include transmitter functionality which introduces higher levels of risk. RFID readers are, by definition, transmitters and are not permitted in secure spaces.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.6.59.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Must" CID="2956">Agencies MUST conduct and document a risk assessment before implementing or adopting an RFID solution.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.6.59.C.02." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Must" CID="2957">This risk assessment MUST be the basis of a security architecture design.</paragraph></block><block title="11.6.60. Security Architecture"><paragraph title="11.6.60.R.01.">The foundation of strong security architecture in RFID follows three important principles:
Controlled access to the data &#x2013; only authorised entities (people, systems, devices) can read and write information to and from the RFID tags (EPC number, tag identifier, kill password, access password and user memory) and RFID databases;
Control over access to the system &#x2013; only authorised entities can configure or add devices to the system, and all devices on the system are authentic and trustworthy;
Confidence and trust &#x2013; back-end systems are designed and implemented in accordance with the current version of the NZISM.
</paragraph><paragraph title="11.6.60.R.02.">Sensitive data should be held in a secure RFID Enterprise Subsystem and retrieved using the tag&#x2019;s unique identifier with only an identifier stored on the tag itself. The Enterprise RFID subsystem should be established as a separate domain where data can be more adequately protected. This structure makes it more difficult for adversaries to obtain information from the tag through scanning or eavesdropping. Data encryption and access control is often more cost-effectively performed in the enterprise subsystem than in the RF subsystem.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.6.60.R.03.">Some RFID systems may cover several organisations, for example in supply chains. In such cases, multiple organisations may require access to databases that contain tag identifiers and passwords. The security architecture should incorporate strong security controls including the authentication of external entities, incident management, audit logging and other essential security controls.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.6.60.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Must" CID="2962">Agencies MUST develop a strong security architecture to protect RFID databases and RFID systems.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.6.60.C.02." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Must" CID="2963">Agencies MUST minimise the information stored on RFID tags and in the RFID subsystem.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.6.60.C.03." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="2964">Agencies SHOULD disable any rewrite functions on RFID devices.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.6.60.C.04." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="2965">Agencies SHOULD apply the access control requirements of the NZISM (Chapter 11 - Communications Systems and Devices) to RFID systems.</paragraph></block><block title="11.6.61. Policy"><paragraph title="11.6.61.R.01.">An RFID Usage Policy is an essential component of an agency&#x2019;s privacy policy, addressing topics such as how personal information is stored and shared. The RFID usage policy should also address privacy issues associated with the tag identifier formats and the potential disclosure of information based solely on the tag identifier format selected. Agencies MAY be required to ensure that devices that collect and store data comply with relevant regulation and guidance, such as the Privacy Act and the HIPAA. Refer also to Chapter&#xA0;20 &#x2013; Data Management.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.6.61.R.02.">Any RFID implementation should also be incorporated into the agency&#x2019;s security policies. Refer also to Chapter 5 &#x2013; Information Security Documentation.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.6.61.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="2969">Agencies SHOULD develop, implement and maintain an RFID Usage Policy.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.6.61.C.02." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="2970">Agencies SHOULD incorporate RFID into the agency&#x2019;s security policies and information security documentation.</paragraph></block><block title="11.6.62. Inspections "><paragraph title="11.6.62.R.01.">Many system component manufacturers use RFID tags to track shipments. RFID tags may be embedded in the packaging, printed on the reverse of labels, attached to or embedded in the device itself. The ability to identify and track devices may pose a security concern for secure areas or equipment deployed in high security applications.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.6.62.C.01." classifications="Confidential, Secret, Top Secret" compliances="Must" CID="2973">Agencies MUST conduct visual and technical inspections of packaging and devices to determine if RFID devices have been attached and either permanently disable or remove such devices.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.6.62.C.02." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="2974">Agencies SHOULD conduct visual inspections of packaging and devices to determine if RFID devices have been attached and if these RFID devices pose a security concern.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.6.62.C.03." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="2975">Agencies SHOULD conduct visual inspections of packaging and devices to determine if RFID devices or labelling have been tampered with and whether this is a security concern.</paragraph></block><block title="11.6.63. Shielding"><paragraph title="11.6.63.R.01.">RF shielding is designed to limit the propagation of RF signals outside of the shielded area. Shielding helps to prevent unauthorised reading, access to or modification of the RFID tag data or interfering with RFID readers. Shielding can be applied to small, individual items, such as passports and credit cards or to large elements such as shipping containers. The requirement for shielding is determined by the risk assessment and an engineering assessment.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.6.63.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="2978">Agencies SHOULD consider undertaking an RF engineering assessment where security concerns exist or where the RFID systems are to be used in areas with high levels of RF activity.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.6.63.C.02." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="2979">Shielding SHOULD be considered where eavesdropping or RF radiation is a concern, as determined by the risk assessment.</paragraph></block><block title="11.6.64. Positioning of Tags and Readers "><paragraph title="11.6.64.R.01.">In order to minimise unnecessary electromagnetic radiation tags and readers should be carefully positioned. Care should be taken in use of RFID readers in proximity to:
Fuel, ordnance, and other hazardous materials,&#xA0;
Humans and sensitive products (e.g., blood, medicine) that may be harmed by sustained exposure to RF radiation,&#xA0;
Metal and reflective objects that can modify and amplify signals in unintended and potentially harmful ways, and&#xA0;
Legitimate radio and Wi-Fi systems to avoid interference.
</paragraph><paragraph title="11.6.64.R.02.">Tag location cannot always be controlled, such as when tags are used to track mobile items or goods in transit. Other difficulties occur with persistent radio interference. In these situations, relocation of readers and tags may provide a solution. Consideration should be given to alternative but cost-effective RF protection measures, such as grounded wire fencing. The engineering assessment undertaken to determine the shielding requirements will assist in determining such measures.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.6.64.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="2983">Agencies SHOULD consider placement of tags and location of readers to avoid unnecessary electromagnetic radiation.</paragraph></block><block title="11.6.65. Encoding and Encryption"><paragraph title="11.6.65.R.01.">If an adversary reads an identifier that is encoded with a published format, such as in the EPC standard, an adversary may be able to obtain useful information such as the manufacturer or issuer of the item, as well as the type of item. Because RFID tags hold limited information and identifier formats are published in standards, it may be important to use identifier formats that do not reveal any information about tagged items or the agency using the RFID system. This will be determined in the risk assessment. Encoding schemes to limit information revealed from unauthorised scanning may include serially or randomly assigning identifiers.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.6.65.R.02.">Adversaries can often obtain valuable information from the identifier alone. For example, knowledge of the EPC manager ID and object class bits may reveal the make and model of tagged objects in a container. If individual items or boxes of items are tagged, the quantities may also be discernible. An adversary might target containers based on their contents.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.6.65.R.03.">The smallest tags generally used for consumer items, such as clothing, do not have enough computing power to support data encryption. At best these tags can cater for PIN-style or password-based protection. Data can, however, be encrypted before it is stored on a tag. In these designs, encryption is undertaken by the RFID subsystem or the RFID reader. This is an effective means of protecting the data on a tag. Refer also to Chapter 17 &#x2013; Cryptography.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.6.65.R.04.">The current Gen 2 standard provides for an on-chip 16-bit Pseudo-Random Number Generator (RNG) and a 16-bit Cyclic Redundancy Code (CRC-16) to protect tag/reader channels. Neither of these encryption methods is strong because of the short bit length in the RNG and because CRCs are not suitable for protection against malicious alteration of data.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.6.65.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Must" CID="2989">Agencies MUST follow the requirements of the NZISM in the selection and implementation of cryptographic protocols and algorithms, and in key management, detailed in Chapter 17 - Cryptography.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.6.65.C.02." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="2990">Agencies SHOULD encrypt data before it is written to RFID tags.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.6.65.C.03." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="2991">Agencies SHOULD assign RFID identifiers using formats that limit information about tagged items or about the agency operating the RFID system.</paragraph></block><block title="11.6.66. Authentication"><paragraph title="11.6.66.R.01.">Both an RFID reader and RFID tag share a common secret key that can be used in combination with a hash algorithm to provide one-way or mutual authentication between tag and reader. This is known as a Keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code (HMAC). When HMAC is applied to messages, it also assures the integrity of data in the messages. HMAC is not specified in any RFID standard, but the capability is generally available in vendor products. HMAC is often used where the risk of eavesdropping is high and passwords alone are considered to offer an inadequate authentication mechanism. This will be determined by the risk assessment. HMAC is also used where applications require evidence of a tag&#x2019;s authenticity.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.6.66.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="2994">Agencies SHOULD consider the use of HMAC when tag authenticity is required.</paragraph></block><block title="11.6.67. Password Management"><paragraph title="11.6.67.R.01.">RFID tags generally require passwords before execution of commands such as reading and writing of tag data, memory access control, and the tag kill feature. Passwords are an important control in maintaining the security and integrity of the RFID system. Refer also to Chapter 16 &#x2013; Access Control.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.6.67.R.02.">Tags should not share passwords, although this may not be practical in all cases. In applications such as supply chains, multiple organisations may require access to databases that contain tag identifiers and passwords. In such cases external entities must be authenticated and incident management, audit logging and other security controls are essential. While in traditional IT systems, passwords are often changed on a periodic basis, in RFID systems, such changes may be impractical, especially if the tags are not always accessible to the agency assigning the passwords.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.6.67.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Must" CID="2998">Agencies MUST assign passwords for critical RFID functions.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.6.67.C.02." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="2999">Agencies SHOULD follow the guidance for passwords management in the NZISM (Chapter 16 &#x2013; Access Control).</paragraph></block><block title="11.6.68. Temporary Deactivation of Tags"><paragraph title="11.6.68.R.01.">The RF interface on some tags can be temporarily deactivated. In a supply chain application, for example, tags may be turned off to prevent unauthorised access to the tags during shipment. This feature is useful when communication between readers and a tag is infrequent allowing the tag to be activated when required but limiting vulnerability to rogue transactions if left operational for extended periods with no authorised activity. Temporary deactivation can also extend battery life in powered tags.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.6.68.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="3002">Agencies SHOULD consider temporary deactivation of RFID tags where the tag is likely to be inactive for extended periods.</paragraph></block><block title="11.6.69. Incident Management"><paragraph title="11.6.69.R.01.">Incident management and audit procedures, logging and time stamps help detect and manage security breaches. These are important tools in protecting systems and managing security breaches.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.6.69.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Must" CID="3006">Agencies MUST develop and implement incident identification and management processes in accordance with this manual (See Chapter 5 &#x2013; Information Security Documentation, Chapter 6 &#x2013; Information Security Monitoring, Chapter 7 &#x2013; Information Security Incidents, Chapter 9 &#x2013; Personnel Security and Chapter 16 &#x2013; Access Control).</paragraph></block><block title="11.6.70. Disposal"><paragraph title="11.6.70.R.01.">Tag disposal and recycling procedures that permanently disable or destroy sensitive data reduces the possibility that they could be used later for tracking or targeting, and prevents access to sensitive data stored on tags. In addition the continued operating presence of a tag after it has performed its intended function can pose a business intelligence or privacy risk, including tracking, targeting or access to sensitive data on the tag.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.6.70.R.02.">Disposal may be undertaken electronically by using a tag&#x2019;s &#x201C;kill&#x201D; feature or using a strong electromagnetic field to permanently deactivate a tag&#x2019;s circuitry. Alternatively physical destruction can be achieved by tearing or shredding. Where a tag supports an electronic deactivation mechanism, tags should be electronically deactivated before physical destruction.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.6.70.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="3010">Agencies SHOULD consider secure disposal procedures and incorporate these into the RFID Usage Policy. Refer also to Chapter 13 &#x2013; Decommissioning and Disposal.</paragraph></block><block title="11.6.71. Operator Training and User Awareness"><paragraph title="11.6.71.R.01.">Operator training can help ensure that personnel using the RFID system have the necessary skills and knowledge follow appropriate guidelines and policies. If HERF/HERO/HERP risks are present, appropriate security training covers mitigation techniques, such as safe handling distances.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.6.71.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Must" CID="3047">Agencies MUST develop and implement user awareness and training programmes to support and enable safe use of RFID services (See Section 9.1 &#x2013; Information Security Awareness and Training).</paragraph></block><block title="11.6.72. Secure Spaces"><paragraph title="11.6.72.R.01.">The identification of classes of tags is fundamental to managing the risks of RFID devices in secure spaces. Classes 0 and 1 pose little risk. Other classes of tag (2 to 5), however, have limited data storage capability and active tags include transmitter functionality which introduces higher levels of risk. RFID readers are, by definition, transmitters and are not permitted in secure spaces. Some exceptions may be permitted for testing, and inspection and monitoring purposes. Any such exceptions must be carefully controlled and monitored.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.6.72.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Must Not" CID="3052">Any RFID tags of class 3, 4, or 5 MUST NOT be permitted in secure spaces.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.6.72.C.02." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Must Not" CID="3054">RFID readers MUST NOT be permitted in secure spaces.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.6.72.C.03." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should Not" CID="3055">Class 2 RFID tags SHOULD NOT be permitted in secure spaces.</paragraph></block></subsection><subsection title="Abbreviations"><paragraph title="11.6.73.">

RFID is technology utilising electromagnetic or electrostatic coupling in the radio frequency (RF) portion of the electromagnetic spectrum to uniquely identify an object, item, animal, or person. RFID is increasingly used as replacement for bar codes. An RFID system consists of three components: an antenna, transceiver (usually the RFID reader) and a transponder (also known as a tag).




Secure Access Module


A Secure Access Module (or Secure Application Module) is used to enhance the security and cryptographic performance of devices. SAMs are commonly found in devices needing to perform secure transactions, such as payment terminals. It can be used for cryptographic computation and secure authentication against smart cards or contactless EMV cards.
Physically a SAM card can either be a separate component and plugged into a device when required or incorporated into an integrated circuit.



Tag

The transponder in an RFID system, frequently found attached to an item or object to provide electronic identification.

Card Access Control Systems"><subsection title="Objective"><paragraph title="11.7.1.">To ensure Access Control Systems incorporating contactless RFID or smart cards are used safely and securely in order to protect privacy, prevent unauthorised access and to prevent the compromise of secure spaces.</paragraph></subsection><subsection title="Context"><block title="Scope "><paragraph title="11.7.2.">This section provides information relating to the risks, security and secure use of RFID or smart cards in access control systems. This section does not discuss biometric access control systems.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.7.3.">The previous section (11.6. Radio Frequency Identification Devices) provides background information and technical detail of the RFID aspects and should be read in conjunction with this section.</paragraph></block><block title="Background"><paragraph title="11.7.4.">Contactless access control systems based on RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) has largely replaced earlier technologies such as magnetic swipe cards in almost all security-critical applications. Two generations of RFID access cards exist:
an earlier generation of cards, which use only basic proprietary security mechanisms; and&#xA0;
a more recent generation that incorporates advances in CMOS and smart card technology to implement cryptography and other protective measures.
</paragraph><paragraph title="11.7.5.">Older access control systems often incorporated a magnetic strip and were easily cloned. More recent systems support the use of PINs in addition to RFID. Unfortunately PINs are also sometimes stored on the cards, often unencrypted and unprotected, and thus facilitating attacks on both the card and the PIN.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.7.6.">Access control systems typically comprise four components:
A reader that programmes the access cards for particular employees and their permitted access to parts of the site, building to secure areas.
A transceiver at each control point to communicate with cards.
A controller to control the locks of access points (doors).
The backend system that hosts all permissions and authorised data and interfaces with the reader, transceiver and controllers.
</paragraph><paragraph title="11.7.7.">Traditionally access control systems were hosted by stand-alone equipment. Modern access control system may be hosted on standard computer equipment and hosted in the organisation&#x2019;s datacentre. It is possible that a system intrusion can target access control systems, making the switches, gates and locks remotely accessible.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.7.8.">Low frequency RFID badge systems use 125KHz, (ISO 11784/5 and ISO 14223). Newer high frequency RFID cards use 13.56MHz (ISO 15693, ISO 14443 and ISO 18000-3).</paragraph><paragraph title="11.7.9.">Some cards also operate at UHF frequencies of 850-960Mhz (ISO 18000-6). Some cards are designed to operate at low and high frequencies by embedding multiple antennae in the cards.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.7.10.">The ISO/IEC 14443 standard for contactless smart card communications defines two types of contactless cards ("A" and "B") and allows for communications at distances up to 10 cm operating at 13.56 MHz.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.7.11.">The alternative ISO/IEC 15693 standard allows communications at distances up to 50 cm. The ISO/IEC 7816 standard (in 15 parts) defines the physical, electrical interface and operating characteristics of these cards.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.7.12.">UHF cards follow the EPC Global Gen2 standard and the ISO 18000-6 standards and are designed to operate at distances of up to 10 metres.</paragraph></block><block title="Smart Cards"><paragraph title="11.7.13.">Smart cards typically incorporate an embedded integrated circuit typically incorporating a microchip with internal memory, a read-only CSN (Card Serial Number) or a UID (User Identification). The card connects to a reader with direct physical contact or a contactless radio frequency (RFID) interface. With an embedded microchip, smart cards can store large amounts of data, carry out on-card functions (such as encryption and authentication) and interact intelligently with a smart card reader. Smart card technology can be found in a variety of form factors, including plastic cards, key fobs, watches, subscriber identification modules used in mobile phones, and USB-based tokens. Smart cards are widely used in payment card (debit and credit cards and electronic wallets) and access control systems.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.7.14.">In common with other RFID devices, smart cards incorporate an antenna embedded in the body of the card (or key fob, watch or token). When the card is brought within range of the reader, the chip in the card is powered on. Once powered on, an RF communication protocol is initiated and communication established between the card and the reader for data transfer.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.7.15.">Smart cards typically incorporate protective mechanisms including authentication, secure data storage, encryption, tamper-resistance and secure communication. Support for biometric authentication may also be incorporated.</paragraph></block><block title="Near Field Communication (NFC)"><paragraph title="11.7.16.">NFC is an RFID technology that enables two electronic devices to establish communication by bringing them within 4 cm of each other. As with other "proximity" technologies, NFC employs electromagnetic induction between two loop antennae when NFC devices exchange information. NFC operates in the globally available unlicensed radio frequency band of 13.56&#xA0;MHz conforming to the ISO/IEC 18000-3 standard. In access control applications these devices are sometimes known as &#x201C;prox cards&#x201D;.</paragraph></block><block title="Attacks"><paragraph title="11.7.17.">In addition to attacks on RFID components described in the previous section, access control cards can be susceptible to relay and chip hacking attacks.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.7.18.">Relay attacks rely on rogue readers to activate the tag even when not in proximity to a legitimate reader. The card holder will be unaware that such an attack is underway. An effective defence is to incorporate distance-to-reader verification although few RFID systems incorporate this mechanism.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.7.19.">Signals between cards and a legitimate reader can be intercepted at distances of up to a metre. Greater distances are possible with higher powered equipment, special antennae and in low interference environments. The signals and data, including card credentials, are captured off-line and used to clone access cards. Again the card holder will be unaware that such an attack is underway.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.7.20.">Chip hacking is facilitated by physical access to the card but can be mitigated by second factor authentication, encryption of data on the card and card tamper detection.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.7.21.">Threats, vulnerabilities and mitigations of RFID access control systems are summarised in the table below:

Refer also to Chapter 12 &#x2013; Product Security.</paragraph></block><block title="Secure Access Module"><paragraph title="11.7.23.">A Secure Access Module (or Secure Application Module - SAM) is used to enhance the security and cryptographic performance of devices. SAMs are commonly found in devices needing to perform secure transactions, such as payment terminals. It can be used for cryptographic computation and secure authentication against smart cards or contactless payment cards.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.7.24.">Physically a SAM card can either be a separate component and plugged into a device when required or incorporated into an integrated circuit. A typically use is for the secure storage of cryptographic keys or other sensitive data. SAM hardware and software are designed to prevent information leakage and incorporates countermeasures against electromagnetic radiation, timing measurements, and other side channel attacks. These properties mean that SAMs offer a much higher level of protection than the terminals and readers, which often utilise general-purpose computers.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.7.25.">SAM&#x2019;s typically support 3DES and AES cryptographic algorithms and SHA hashing algorithms in their hardware cryptographic co-processor implementations. Refer to Chapter 17 for information on approved cryptographic algorithms and protocols. It is important to note that 3DES is approved for use on legacy systems only and SHA-1 is not an approved hashing algorithm.</paragraph></block><block title="Card Protection"><paragraph title="11.7.26.">RFID blocking wallets and RFID card sleeves are available to block RFID frequencies. These are typically used for the protection of credit and other payment, access, transit cards and e-passports as a countermeasure for skimming attacks.</paragraph></block></subsection><subsection title="References - Guidance"><paragraph title="11.7.27.">Further references on Guidance can be found at:

Risk Assessment"><paragraph title="11.7.29.R.01.">As with many technologies, adoption of RFID access cards has the potential to introduce a wide range of risks in addition to the risks that already exist for agency systems. This may compromise the cards and enable unauthorised access, in addition to RFID risks discussed in the previous section. A risk assessment is an essential tool in determining and assessing the range and extent of risk and threat in the use of RFID access cards.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.7.29.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Must" CID="3130">Agencies MUST conduct and document a risk assessment before implementing or adopting an RFID access card system.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.7.29.C.02." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Must" CID="3131">This risk assessment MUST be the basis of a security architecture design.</paragraph></block><block title="11.7.30. Security Architecture"><paragraph title="11.7.30.R.01.">The foundation of strong security architecture in RFID follows these important principles:
Physical Security - over readers, secure areas, issued and unissued access cards;
Controlled access to the data &#x2013; only authorised entities (people, systems, devices) can read and write information to the cards, card databases and backend systems;
Control over access to the system &#x2013; only authorised entities can configure or add devices to the system, and all devices on the system are authentic and trustworthy;
Confidence and trust &#x2013; back-end systems are designed and implemented in accordance with the current version of the NZISM. This includes intrusion detection and incident management mechanisms and procedures.
</paragraph><paragraph title="11.7.30.R.02.">Some access systems may cover several organisations or sites. In such cases, multiple organisations or sites may require access to databases that contain personnel identifiers, passwords and access permissions. The security architecture should incorporate strong security controls including the authentication of external entities, incident management, audit logging and other essential security controls.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.7.30.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Must" CID="3138">Agencies MUST develop a strong security architecture to protect access to databases and systems.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.7.30.C.02." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="3139">Agencies SHOULD apply the NZISM access controls (Chapter 11) and cryptographic controls (Chapter 17) to access card systems.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.7.30.C.03." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="3141">Agencies SHOULD consider the application of the following design elements:
Implement a Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) to isolate card systems from other parts of the organisation&#x2019;s network and from high-risk Internet Protocol (IP) network connections;
Secure or remove connections between the Internet and card system network segments;
Secure or remove vulnerable dialup modem links;&#xA0;
Secure or remove vulnerable wireless radio links and network access points; and
Network activity monitoring for unusual or anomalous access activity and well as intrusion detection.
</paragraph></block><block title="11.7.31.

Refer also to Chapter&#xA0;20 &#x2013; Data Management.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.7.31.R.02.">Any access card implementation should also be incorporated into the agency&#x2019;s security policies. Refer also to Chapter 5 &#x2013; Information Security Documentation.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.7.31.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="3156">Agencies SHOULD develop, implement and maintain an Access Card Usage Policy.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.7.31.C.02." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="3157">Agencies SHOULD incorporate access cards into the agency&#x2019;s security policies and information security documentation.</paragraph></block><block title="11.7.32. Physical Security"><paragraph title="11.7.32.R.01.">Physical security over readers, door controls, cables and control systems, as well as the cards themselves is fundamental to the operation of a secure system.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.7.32.R.02.">In order to minimise unnecessary electromagnetic radiation readers and control equipment should be carefully positioned. Care should be taken with the use of card readers in proximity to:
Fuel, ordnance, and other hazardous materials,&#xA0;
Metal and reflective objects that can modify and amplify signals in unintended and potentially harmful ways, and&#xA0;
Legitimate radio systems to avoid interference.

Card Data Protection"><paragraph title="11.7.33.R.01.">Cards are invariably retained by the card holder and subject to loss, theft or being misplaced. Cards are also not always within the control of the card holder outside of normal office hours. Measures to protect cards in these situations are fundamental to the maintenance of the integrity and security of the access control system.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.7.33.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Must" CID="3171">Agencies MUST follow the requirements of the NZISM in the selection and implementation of cryptographic protocols and algorithms, and in key management, detailed in Chapter 17 - Cryptography.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.7.33.C.02." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="3173">Agencies SHOULD encrypt data before it is written to cards.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.7.33.C.03." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="3175">Agencies SHOULD consider the use of cards systems incorporating Secure Access Modules (SAMs).</paragraph></block><block title="11.7.34. Incident Management"><paragraph title="11.7.34.R.01.">Incident management and audit procedures, logging and time stamps help detect and manage security breaches. These are important tools in protecting systems and managing security breaches.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.7.34.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Must" CID="3180">Agencies MUST develop and implement incident identification and management processes in accordance with this manual (See Chapter 5 &#x2013; Information Security Documentation, Chapter 6 &#x2013; Information Security Monitoring, Chapter 7 &#x2013; Information Security Incidents, Chapter 9 &#x2013; Personnel Security and Chapter 16 &#x2013; Access Control).</paragraph></block><block title="11.7.35. Disposal"><paragraph title="11.7.35.R.01.">Card disposal and recycling procedures that permanently disable or destroy sensitive data reduces the possibility that they could be used later for tracking or targeting, and prevents access to sensitive data stored on cards. In addition the continued operating presence of a card after it has performed its intended function can pose an unauthorised access, business intelligence or privacy risk, including tracking and targeting of personnel or access to sensitive data on the access card.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.7.35.R.02.">Disposal may be undertaken by electronically by using a card&#x2019;s wipe feature or using a strong electromagnetic field to permanently deactivate a tag&#x2019;s circuitry. Alternatively physical destruction can be achieved by tearing or shredding. Where a tag supports an electronic deactivation mechanism, tags should be electronically deactivated before physical destruction.</paragraph><paragraph title="11.7.35.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="3189">Agencies SHOULD consider secure disposal procedures and incorporate these into the Access Card Usage Policy.

Where further advice is required, consult the GCSB.</paragraph></block><block title="Convergence"><paragraph title="12.1.5.">Convergence is the integration of a number of discrete technologies into one product. Converged solutions can include the advantages and disadvantages of each discrete technology.</paragraph><paragraph title="12.1.6.">Most products will exhibit some element of convergence. When products have converged elements, agencies will need to comply with the relevant areas of this manual for the discrete technologies when deploying the converged product.</paragraph><paragraph title="12.1.7.">As an example, when agencies choose to use evaluated media, such as encrypted flash memory media, the requirements for evaluated products, media and cryptographic security apply.</paragraph></block></subsection><subsection title="Assurance"><block title="Determining Assurance"><paragraph title="12.1.9.">In order to determine the level of assurance (the EAL), the CC standard requires tests, checks and evaluations in several areas. Higher levels of assurance require more extensive design, documentation, testing and evaluation. Determining assurance requires assessment of the following elements:
Development;
Guidance documents;
Life-cycle support;
Security Target evaluation;
Tests; and
Vulnerability assessment.
</paragraph></block><block title="Augmented Assurance"><paragraph title="12.1.10.">It is possible to &#x201C;augment&#x201D; an evaluation to provide additional assurance without changing the fundamental assurance level. This mechanism allows the addition of assurance components not specifically required for a specific level of evaluation or the substitution of assurance components from the specification of another hierarchically higher assurance component. Of the assurance constructs defined in the CC, only EALs may be augmented. An augmented EAL is often indicated by a &#x201D;+&#x201D;-sign (for example EAL4+). The concept of negative augmentation or an &#x201C;EAL minus&#x201D; is not recognised by the standard.</paragraph></block><block title="High Assurance"><paragraph title="12.1.11.">High Assurance is a generic term encompassing EAL levels 5, 6 and 7.

Common Criteria;
high assurance evaluation; or
an Australasian Information Security Evaluation Program (AISEP) approved evaluation.
</paragraph><paragraph title="12.1.13.">The AISEP Evaluated Products List (EPL) is maintained by the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD)&#xA0;and provides a listing of approved products for the protection of classified information.

Before choosing a product that has not been evaluated by the AISEP, agencies are encouraged to contact the GCSB to enquire whether the product will be recognised for New Zealand use once it has complete evaluation in a foreign scheme.</paragraph><paragraph title="12.1.17.">Two such recognition arrangements are for the Common Criteria Recognition Arrangement up to the assurance level of EAL2 with the lifecycle flaw remediation augmentation and for degausser products listed on the National Security Agency/Central Security Service&#x2019;s EPLD.</paragraph></block><block title="Australasian Information Security Evaluation Program (AISEP)"><paragraph title="12.1.18.">The AISEP exists to ensure that a range of evaluated products are available to meet the needs of Australian and New Zealand Government agencies.</paragraph><paragraph title="12.1.19.">The AISEP performs the following functions:
evaluation and certification of products using the Common Criteria;
continued maintenance of the assurance of evaluated products; and
recognition of products evaluated by a foreign scheme with which the AISEP has a mutual recognition agreement (generally the Common Criteria Recognition Agreement &#x2013; CCRA).
</paragraph></block><block title="Protection Profiles"><paragraph title="12.1.20.">A Protection Profile (PP) describes the security functionality that must be included in a Common Criteria evaluation to meet a range of defined threats. PPs also define the activities to be taken to assess the security functions of a product. Agencies can have confidence that a product evaluated against an AISEP or GCSB approved PP addresses the defined threats. Approved PPs are published on the AISEP Evaluated Product List.</paragraph><paragraph title="12.1.21.">The introduction of PP&#x2019;s is to reduce the time required for evaluation, compared with the traditional approach to allow the AISEP to keep pace with the rapid evolution, production and release of security products and updates. &#xA0;Cryptographic security functionality is included in the scope of evaluation against an approved Protection Profile.&#xA0;</paragraph><paragraph title="12.1.22.">To facilitate the transition to AISEP approved Protection Profiles, a cap of Evaluation Assurance Level (EAL) 2 applies for all traditional AISEP (EAL based evaluations), including for technologies with no existing approved Protection Profile. EAL 2 is considered to represent a sensible trade-off between completion time and meaningful security assurance gains.</paragraph><paragraph title="12.1.23.">Evaluations conducted in other nations&#x2019; Common Criteria schemes will continue to be recognised by the GCSB under the AISEP.</paragraph><paragraph title="12.1.24.">Some High Assurance evaluations continue to be conducted in European Approved Testing Facilities and use the EAL rating scheme. ASD run an independent High Assurance Evaluation scheme which is not related to AISEP or an EAL rating.</paragraph><paragraph title="12.1.25.">It is important that Agencies check the evaluation has examined the security enforcing functions by reviewing the target of evaluation/security target and other testing documentation.</paragraph><paragraph title="12.1.26.">The UK utilises several product evaluation schemes such as the CESG Assisted Products Service (CAPS), CESG Assured Service (CAS) and IT Security Evaluation Criteria (ITSEC). Agencies should consult the GCSB if further clarity on the utilisation of these evaluation schemes and products is required.</paragraph></block></subsection><subsection title="Product Selection"><paragraph title="12.1.27.">The UK utilises several product evaluation schemes such as the CESG Assisted Products Service (CAPS), CESG Assured Service (CAS) and IT Security Evaluation Criteria (ITSEC).

Evaluated product selection preference order"><paragraph title="12.1.30.R.01.">In selecting products for use, agencies should note that completed evaluations provide greater assurance than those products that are still undergoing evaluation or have not completed any formal evaluation activity. This assurance gradation is reflected in the preference order for selecting security products. If an agency selects a product that is ranked lower in the preference order, the justification for this decision MUST be recorded.</paragraph><paragraph title="12.1.30.R.02.">For products that are currently in evaluation, agencies should select those that are undergoing evaluation through AISEP in preference to those being conducted in a recognised foreign scheme. If a major vulnerability is found during the course of an AISEP evaluation, the GCSB may advise agencies on appropriate risk reduction strategies.</paragraph><paragraph title="12.1.30.R.03.">It is important to recognise that a product that is under evaluation has not, and might never, complete all relevant evaluation processes.</paragraph><paragraph title="12.1.30.R.04.">Agencies should be aware that while this section provides a product selection preference order, policy stated elsewhere in this manual, or product specific advice from the GCSB, could override this standard by specifying more rigorous requirements for particular functions and device use.</paragraph><paragraph title="12.1.30.R.05.">Additionally, where an EAL rating is mandated for a product to perform a cryptographic function for the protection of data at rest or in transit, as specified within Chapter 17 &#x2013; Cryptography, products that have not completed an Approved Evaluation do not satisfy the requirement.</paragraph><paragraph title="12.1.30.C.01." classifications="Confidential, Secret, Top Secret" compliances="Must" CID="3284">Agencies MUST select products in the following order of preference:
a protection profile (PP) evaluated product;
products having completed an evaluation through the AISEP or recognised under the Common Criteria Recognition Arrangement (CCRA);
products in evaluation in the AISEP;&#xA0;
products in evaluation in a scheme where the outcome will be recognised by the GCSB when the evaluation is complete; or

</paragraph></block><block title="12.1.31. Evaluated product selection"><paragraph title="12.1.31.R.01.">A product listed on the EPL might not meet the security requirements of an agency.&#xA0; This could occur for a number of reasons, including that the scope of the evaluation is inappropriate for the intended use or the operational environment differs from that assumed in the evaluation.&#xA0; As such, an agency should ensure that a product is suitable by reviewing all available documentation.&#xA0; In the case of Common Criteria certified products, this documentation includes the protection profile, target of evaluation, security target, certification report, consumer guide and any qualifications and limitations contained in the entry on the EPL.</paragraph><paragraph title="12.1.31.R.02.">Products that are in evaluation will not have a certification report and may not have a published security target. A protection profile will, as a rule, exist. A draft security target can be obtained from the GCSB for products that are in evaluation through AISEP. For products that are in evaluation through a foreign scheme, the vendor can be contacted directly for further information.</paragraph><paragraph title="12.1.31.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="3294">Agencies SHOULD select products that have their desired security functionality within the scope of the product&#x2019;s evaluation and are applicable to the agency&#x2019;s intended environment.</paragraph></block><block title="12.1.32. Product specific requirements"><paragraph title="12.1.32.R.01.">Whilst this manual may recommend a minimum level of assurance in the evaluation of a product&#x2019;s security functionality not all evaluated products may be found suitable for their intended purpose even if they pass their Common Criteria evaluation. Typically such products will have cryptographic functionality that is not covered in sufficient depth under the Common Criteria. Where products have specific usage requirements, in addition to this manual, or supersede requirements in this manual, they will be outlined in the product&#x2019;s consumer guide.</paragraph><paragraph title="12.1.32.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Must" CID="3299">Agencies MUST check consumer guides for products, where available, to determine any product specific requirements.</paragraph><paragraph title="12.1.32.C.02." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Must" CID="3304">Where product specific requirements exist in a consumer guide, agencies MUST comply with the requirements outlined in the consumer guide.</paragraph><paragraph title="12.1.32.C.03." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Must" CID="3306">Agencies selecting high assurance products and HGCE MUST contact the GCSB and comply with any product specific requirements, before any purchase is made.</paragraph></block><block title="12.1.33. Sourcing non-evaluated software"><paragraph title="12.1.33.R.01.">Software downloaded from websites on the Internet can contain malicious code or malicious content that is installed along with the legitimate software. Agencies need to confirm the integrity of the software they are installing before deploying it on a system to ensure that no unintended software is installed at the same time.</paragraph><paragraph title="12.1.33.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="3310">Agencies SHOULD:
obtain software from verifiable sources and verify its integrity using vendor supplied checksums; and
validate the software&#x2019;s interaction with the operating systems and network within a test environment prior to use on operational systems.
</paragraph></block><block title="12.1.34. Delivery of evaluated products"><paragraph title="12.1.34.R.01.">It is important that agencies ensure that the selected product is the actual product received. If the product differs from the evaluated version, then NO assurance can be gained from an evaluation being previously performed.</paragraph><paragraph title="12.1.34.R.02.">For products evaluated under the ITSEC or the Common Criteria scheme at EAL2 or higher, delivery information is available from the developer in the delivery procedures document.</paragraph><paragraph title="12.1.34.R.03.">For products that do not have evaluated delivery procedures, it is recommended that agencies assess whether the vendor&#x2019;s delivery procedures are sufficient to maintain the integrity of the product.</paragraph><paragraph title="12.1.34.R.04.">Other factors that the assessment of the delivery procedures for products might consider include:
the intended environment of the product;
likely attack vectors;
the types of attackers that the product will defend against;
the resources of any potential attackers;
the likelihood of an attack;
the level of importance of maintaining confidentiality of the product purchase; and
the level of importance of ensuring adherence to delivery timeframes.
</paragraph><paragraph title="12.1.34.R.05.">Delivery procedures can vary greatly from product to product. For most products the standard commercial practice for packaging and delivery can be sufficient for agencies requirements. More secure delivery procedures can include measures to detect tampering or masquerading. Some examples of specific security measures include tamper evident seals, cryptographic checksums and signatures, and secure transportation.</paragraph><paragraph title="12.1.34.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Must" CID="3318">Agencies procuring high assurance products and HGCE MUST contact the GCSB and comply with any product specific delivery procedures.</paragraph><paragraph title="12.1.34.C.02." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="3320">Agencies SHOULD ensure that products are delivered in a manner consistent with any delivery procedures defined in associated documentation.</paragraph></block><block title="12.1.35. Delivery of non-evaluated products"><paragraph title="12.1.35.R.01.">When a non-evaluated product is purchased agencies should determine if the product has arrived in a state that they were expecting it to and that there are no obvious signs of tampering.</paragraph><paragraph title="12.1.35.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="3325">Agencies SHOULD ensure that products purchased without the delivery assurances provided through the use of formally evaluated procedures are delivered in a manner that provides confidence that they receive the product that they expect to receive in an unaltered state, including checking:
any labelling changes;
any damage; and
any signs of tampering.
</paragraph></block><block title="12.1.36. Leasing arrangements"><paragraph title="12.1.36.R.01.">Agencies should consider security and policy requirements when entering into a leasing agreement for IT equipment in order to avoid potential information security incidents during maintenance, repairs or disposal processes.</paragraph><paragraph title="12.1.36.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="3330">Agencies SHOULD ensure that leasing agreements for IT equipment takes into account the:
difficulties that could be encountered when the equipment needs maintenance;
control of remote maintenance, software updates and fault diagnosis;
if the equipment can be easily sanitised prior to its return; and
the possible requirement for destruction if sanitisation cannot be performed.
</paragraph></block><block title="12.1.37. Ongoing maintenance of assurance"><paragraph title="12.1.37.R.01.">Developers that have demonstrated a commitment to ongoing maintenance or evaluation are more likely to be responsive to ensuring that security patches are independently assessed.</paragraph><paragraph title="12.1.37.R.02.">A vendor&#x2019;s commitment to assurance continuity can be gauged through the number of evaluations undertaken and whether assurance maintenance has been performed on previous evaluations.</paragraph><paragraph title="12.1.37.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="3337">Agencies SHOULD choose products from developers that have made a commitment to the ongoing maintenance of the assurance of their product.</paragraph></block></subsection></section><section title="12.2.

Use of evaluated products in unevaluated configurations"><paragraph title="12.2.6.R.01.">To ensure that a product will still provide the assurance desired by the agency when used in a manner for which it was not intended, a security risk assessment MUST be conducted upon the altered configuration. The further that a product deviates from its evaluated configuration, the less assurance can be gained from the evaluation.</paragraph><paragraph title="12.2.6.R.02.">Given the potential threat vectors and the value of the classified information being protected, high assurance products and HGCE MUST be configured in accordance with the GCSB&#x2019;s guidelines.</paragraph><paragraph title="12.2.6.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Must" CID="3401">Agencies wishing to use a product in an unevaluated configuration MUST undertake a security risk assessment including:

Provenance is defined as a record of the origin, history, specification changes and supply path of the products or equipment.</paragraph><paragraph title="12.7.18.C.01." classifications="Confidential, Secret, Top Secret" compliances="Must" CID="3669">Agencies MUST require suppliers and contractors to provide the provenance of any products or equipment.</paragraph><paragraph title="12.7.18.C.02." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="3674">Agencies SHOULD require suppliers and contractors to provide the provenance of any products or equipment.</paragraph></block><block title="12.7.19. Security validation"><paragraph title="12.7.19.R.01.">Validation of the performance and security of the equipment is a vital part of the ongoing integrity and security of agency systems. The security design elements and features of the equipment or product will need to be separately considered from any operational drivers. Where compromises in security performance, capability or functionality are apparent, additional risk mitigation, controls and countermeasures may be necessary.</paragraph><paragraph title="12.7.19.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="3691">Agencies SHOULD validate the security of the equipment against security performance, capability and functionality requirements.</paragraph><paragraph title="12.7.19.C.02." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="3693">Where deficiencies in security performance, capability and functionality are identified, agencies SHOULD implement additional risk mitigation measures.</paragraph></block><block title="12.7.20. Pre-Installation Tests and Checks "><paragraph title="12.7.20.R.01.">An essential part of quality and security assurance is the delivery inspection, pre-installation and functional testing of any equipment.

Specific requirements on media handling, usage, sanitisation, destruction and disposal are discussed later in this chapter. System decommissioning is the retirement or termination of a system and its operations. System decommissioning does NOT deal with the theft or loss of equipment.</paragraph></block><block title="Definitions"><paragraph title="13.1.3.">A system decommissioning will have one or more of the following characteristics:
Ending a capability completely i.e. no migration, redevelopment or new version of a capability occurs;
Combining parts of existing capabilities services into a new, different system;
As part of wider redesign, where a capability is no longer provided and is decommissioned or merged with other capabilities or systems.
</paragraph><paragraph title="13.1.4.">ICT requirements evolve as business needs change and technology advances. In some cases this will lead to the retirement and decommissioning of obsolete systems or systems surplus to requirements.</paragraph><paragraph title="13.1.5.">Security requires a structured approach to decommissioning in order to cease information system operations in a planned, orderly and secure manner. It is also important that the approach for decommissioning systems is consistent and coordinated. Sanitisation is important to eliminate any remnant data that could be retrieved by unauthorised parties. These procedures include the following:
A migration plan;
A decommissioning plan;
Archiving;
Safe disposal of equipment and media;
Robust procedures to manage any residual data and associated risk; and
Audit and final signoff.
</paragraph><paragraph title="13.1.6.">As a final step, a review of the decommissioning should be undertaken to ensure no important elements, data or equipment have been overlooked.</paragraph></block></subsection><subsection title="References"><paragraph title="13.1.7.">

Connecting media to systems"><paragraph title="13.3.6.R.01.">Some operating systems provide functionality to automatically execute or read certain types of programs that reside on optical media and flash memory media when connected. While this functionality was designed with a legitimate purpose in mind, such as automatically loading a graphical user interface for the system user to browse the contents of the media, or to install software residing on the media, it can also be used for malicious purposes.</paragraph><paragraph title="13.3.6.R.02.">An attacker can create a file on optical media or a connectable device that the operating system will attempt to automatically execute. &#xA0;When the operating system executes the file, it can have the same effect as when a system user explicitly executes malicious code. &#xA0;The operating system executes the file without asking the system user for permission.</paragraph><paragraph title="13.3.6.R.03.">Some operating systems will cache information on media to improve performance. As such, inserting media of a higher classification into a system of a lower classification could cause data to be read and saved from the device without user intervention.</paragraph><paragraph title="13.3.6.R.04.">Using device access control software will prevent unauthorised media from being attached to a system. Using a whitelisting approach allows security personnel greater control over what can, and what cannot, be connected to the system.</paragraph><paragraph title="13.3.6.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Must" CID="4086">Agencies MUST disable any automatic execution features within operating systems for connectable devices and media.</paragraph><paragraph title="13.3.6.C.02." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Must" CID="4089">Agencies MUST prevent unauthorised media from connecting to a system via the use of:

The reduction of any requirements is based on the original classification of information residing on the media and the level of assurance in the cryptographic product being used to encrypt the media.</paragraph><paragraph title="13.3.8.R.03.">Further information on reducing storage and physical transfer requirements can be found in Section 17.1 - Cryptographic Fundamentals.</paragraph><paragraph title="13.3.8.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Must" CID="4102">Agencies MUST ensure that processes for transferring media containing classified information meets the minimum physical transfer requirements as specified in the PSR.</paragraph><paragraph title="13.3.8.C.02." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="4103">Agencies SHOULD encrypt data stored on media with at least an Approved Cryptographic Algorithm (See Section 17.2 &#x2013; Approved Cryptographic Algorithms) if it is to be transferred to another area or location.</paragraph></block><block title="13.3.9. Using media for data transfers"><paragraph title="13.3.9.R.01.">Agencies transferring data between systems of different security domains or classifications are strongly encouraged to use media such as write-once CDs and DVDs. This will limit opportunity for information from the higher classified systems to be accidently transferred to lower classified systems. This procedure will also make each transfer a single, auditable event.</paragraph><paragraph title="13.3.9.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="4111">Data transfers between systems of different classification SHOULD be logged in an auditable log or register.</paragraph><paragraph title="13.3.9.C.02." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should Not" CID="4114">Agencies transferring data manually between two systems of different security domains or classifications SHOULD NOT use rewriteable media.</paragraph></block><block title="13.3.10. Media in secure areas"><paragraph title="13.3.10.R.01.">Certain types of media including USB, FireWire and eSATA capable devices MUST be disabled or explicitly approved as an exception by the Accreditation Authority for a TOP SECRET environment (the GCSB). This provides an additional level of system user awareness and security.</paragraph><paragraph title="13.3.10.R.02.">This practice should be used in addition to device access control software on workstations in case system users are unaware of, or choose to ignore, security requirements for media.</paragraph><paragraph title="13.3.10.C.01." classifications="Top Secret" compliances="Must Not" CID="4121">Agencies MUST NOT permit any media that uses external interface connections within a TOP SECRET area without prior written approval from the Accreditation Authority.</paragraph></block></subsection></section><section title="13.4.

Further information relating to sanitising IT equipment can be found in Section 12.6 - Product Sanitisation and Disposal.</paragraph></block><block title="Definition"><paragraph title="13.4.3.">Sanitisation is defined as the process of removal of data and information from the storage device such that data recovery using any known technique or analysis is prevented or made unfeasible. The process includes the removal of all useful data from the storage device, including metadata, as well as the removal of all labels, markings, classifications and&#xA0;activity logs. Methods vary depending upon the nature, technology used and construction of the storage device or equipment and may include degaussing, incineration, shredding, grinding, knurling or embossing and chemical immersion.</paragraph></block><block title="Sanitising media and IT Equipment "><paragraph title="13.4.4.">The process of sanitisation does not automatically change the classification of the media&#xA0;or IT Equipment, nor does sanitisation necessarily involve the destruction of media&#xA0;or IT Equipment.</paragraph></block><block title="Product selection"><paragraph title="13.4.5.">Agencies are permitted to use non-evaluated products to sanitise media and IT Equipment. However, the product will still need to meet the specifications and achieve the requirements for sanitising media and IT Equipment as outlined in this section.</paragraph></block><block title="Hybrid hard drives, Solid State Drives and Flash Memory Devices"><paragraph title="13.4.6.">Hybrid hard drives, solid state drives and flash memory devices are difficult or impossible to sanitise effectively. In most cases safe disposal will require destruction, this includes any equipment with integrated memory capability. The sanitisation and post sanitisation treatment requirements for redeployment of such devices should be carefully observed.</paragraph></block><block title="New Zealand Eyes Only (NZEO) Materials"><paragraph title="13.4.7.">NZEO endorsed material requires additional protection at every level of classification. In general terms, media and IT Equipment containing NZEO material should be sanitised and redeployed or sanitised and destroyed in accordance with the procedures in this section. Media and IT Equipment that has contained NZEO material must not be disposed of to e-recyclers or sold to any third party.</paragraph></block></subsection><subsection title="References"><paragraph title="13.4.8.">

Data retention time is reported to range from minutes (at normal room temperatures) to hours (in extreme cold), depending on the temperature of the volatile media. Further, published literature has shown that some volatile media can suffer from long-term data remanence effects resulting from physical changes to the media due to continuous storage of static data for an extended period of time.

Non-volatile magnetic media sanitisation"><paragraph title="13.4.13.R.01.">The following guidance applies in cases where media is to be redeployed.&#xA0;Both the host protected area and device configuration overlay table of non-volatile magnetic hard disks are normally not visible to the operating system or the computer&#x2019;s BIOS. Hence any sanitisation of the readable sectors on the media will not overwrite these hidden sectors leaving any classified information contained in these locations untouched. Some sanitisation programs include the ability to reset devices to their default state removing any host protected areas or device configuration overlays. This allows the sanitisation program to see the entire contents of the media during the subsequent sanitisation process.</paragraph><paragraph title="13.4.13.R.02.">Modern non-volatile magnetic hard disks automatically reallocate space for bad sectors at a hardware level. These bad sectors are maintained in what is known as the growth defects table or &#x2018;g-list&#x2019;. If classified information was stored in a sector that is subsequently added to the g-list, sanitising the media will not overwrite these non-addressable bad sectors, and remnant data will exist in these locations. Whilst these sectors may be considered bad by the device quite often this is due to the sectors no longer meeting expected performance norms for the device and not due to an inability to read/write to the sector.</paragraph><paragraph title="13.4.13.R.03.">The ATA secure erase command is built into the firmware of post-2001 devices and is able to access sectors that have been added to the g-list. Modern non-volatile magnetic hard disks also contain a primary defects table or &#x2018;p-list&#x2019;. The p-list contains a list of bad sectors found during post-production processes. No information is ever stored in sectors on the p-list for a device as they are inaccessible before the media is used for the first time.</paragraph><paragraph title="13.4.13.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Must" CID="4189">Agencies MUST sanitise non-volatile magnetic media by:

Further information relating to the destruction of IT equipment can be found in Section 12.6 - Product Sanitisation and Disposal.</paragraph><paragraph title="13.5.3.">Any IT, electrical or electronic equipment MUST be destroyed and disposed of in an environmentally safe and responsible manner.&#xA0; This reflects an increasing responsibility for improved equipment end-of-life treatment and environmentally responsible disposal solutions, while continuing to meet security and data protection requirements.</paragraph></block><block title="Evolution of electronic components and equipment"><paragraph title="13.5.4.">The capability of various types of electronic equipment to store data has increased significantly with technology advances such as solid-state drives (SSDs) and on-board memory devices.&#xA0; In turn these present a rich target of opportunity to, amongst others, cyber-criminals, unauthorised investigators, and foreign intelligence services.&#xA0; Data may include, for example, identity, account numbers, physical addresses, transactions, cryptographic keys, strategic, financial or other private documents, and classified information.</paragraph><paragraph title="13.5.5.">Where data from a discarded device is recovered, it may also result in a privacy or data breach - potentially incurring sanction from data regulators.</paragraph></block><block title="Electronic Waste (Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE))"><paragraph title="13.5.6.">Media and IT equipment can contain a number of elements such as arsenic, lead, mercury, barium, selenium and cadmium in their manufacture.&#xA0; These elements can be poisonous, carcinogenic or toxic in particulate or dust form.&#xA0; If allowed to accumulate in dumps or poorly managed recycling or disposal centres, they can create a serious health risk or environmental hazard.</paragraph><paragraph title="13.5.7.">Lead was traditionally used in solder on printed circuit boards, although it has been banned in many countries in the last decade. Lead oxide may still be found in cathode-ray tubes and older equipment.&#xA0; Lead is toxic to humans and medical research has raised concerns about the impact of low-level exposure on the development of the brain and central nervous system in children.</paragraph><paragraph title="13.5.8.">Other elements used in the manufacture of IT and electronic equipment may include flame retardants and plasticisers, and should be treated with caution.</paragraph><paragraph title="13.5.9.">Some flame-retardant materials used in computers can be toxic if released as dust into the atmosphere.&#xA0; Research has shown that they interfere with brain and skeletal development.</paragraph><paragraph title="13.5.10.">Phthalates are probably best known as plasticisers and are widely used in the electronics industry.&#xA0; One of the most widely used phthalates, DEHP, is classified by the EU as toxic to reproductive health. For example, in 1999 an EU-wide ban was imposed on the use of six phthalates in children's chewable toys.</paragraph></block><block title="Incinerators"><paragraph title="13.5.11.">There are many risks associated with the incineration of electronic waste. Up-to-date guidance is available on the Ministry for the Environment website (see reference table 13.5.21).</paragraph><paragraph title="13.5.12.">Incinerators discharge into the atmosphere and create emissions and ash residue. There is potential for contamination of air, soil and water through the release of pollutants such as hydrocarbons, heavy metals and dioxins.&#xA0;</paragraph><paragraph title="13.5.13.">There are two main by-products of incineration.&#xA0; Firstly, inert bottom ash which is primarily formed from inorganic elements, and secondly, flue gases. These facilities must include gas cleaning systems designed to contain pollutants and safely exhaust to the atmosphere.&#xA0; Properly designed, installed and operated facilities will be able to manage and safely dispose of the waste, particulate matter and contaminants produced by incineration.&#xA0;</paragraph><paragraph title="13.5.14.">It is essential that any incineration facility is properly rated, inspected and authorised or licenced to process WEEE.&#xA0; Any relevant national environmental legislation and regulation must also be complied with.&#xA0; In particular the Resource Management Act and the National Environmental Standards for Air Quality must be observed.</paragraph><paragraph title="13.5.15.">Some electrical and electronic waste materials cannot be safely incinerated.&#xA0; This includes:
Alkaline batteries;
Glass;
Lithium batteries; and
Mobile phones.
</paragraph></block><block title="Destruction"><paragraph title="13.5.16.">While sanitisation of media and IT equipment can be highly effective in controlled conditions and when applied for specific purposes, it does not provide the high level of assurances on the irrecoverably of data when the media and equipment has left the control of the owner, agency or other organisation.</paragraph><paragraph title="13.5.17.">Destruction provides considerably higher levels of assurance to agencies where non-recoverability of any agency data is a consideration.&#xA0; In many cases destruction is essential, rather than sanitisation and disposal.</paragraph><paragraph title="13.5.18.">The GCSB approves destruction facilities (see also 13.6.11).&#xA0; It is important to note that such approval is specific, confined to the destruction process and DOES NOT endorse or approve the use of any sanitisation process, method or software.</paragraph></block><block title="New Zealand Eyes Only (NZEO) Materials"><paragraph title="13.5.19.">NZEO endorsed material requires additional protection at every level of classification.</paragraph><paragraph title="13.5.20.">In general terms, media and IT Equipment containing NZEO material should be sanitised and redeployed or sanitised and destroyed in accordance with the procedures in this section.

Developing hardened SOEs"><paragraph title="14.1.8.R.01.">Antivirus and anti-malware software, while an important defensive measure, can be defeated by malicious code that has yet to be identified by antivirus vendors. This can include targeted attacks, where a new virus is engineered or an existing one modified to defeat the signature-based detection schemes.</paragraph><paragraph title="14.1.8.R.02.">The use of antivirus and anti-malware software, while adding value to the defence of workstations, cannot be relied solely upon to protect the workstation. As such agencies still need to deploy appropriately hardened SOEs to assist with the protection of workstations against a broader range of security risks.</paragraph><paragraph title="14.1.8.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="1149">Agencies SHOULD develop a hardened SOE for workstations and servers, covering:
removal of unneeded software and operating system components;
removal or disabling of unneeded services, ports and BIOS settings;
disabling of unused or undesired functionality in software and operating systems;
implementation of access controls on relevant objects to limit system users and programs to the minimum access required;
installation of antivirus and anti-malware software;
installation of software-based firewalls limiting inbound and outbound network connections;&#xA0;
configuration of either remote logging or the transfer of local event logs to a central server; and
protection of audit and other logs through the use of a one way pipe to reduce likelihood of compromise key transaction records.
</paragraph></block><block title="14.1.9. Maintaining hardened SOEs"><paragraph title="14.1.9.R.01.">Whilst a SOE can be sufficiently hardened when it is deployed, its security will progressively degrade over time. Agencies can address the degradation of the security of a SOE by ensuring that patches are continually applied, system users are not able to disable or bypass security functionality and antivirus and other security software is appropriately maintained with the latest signatures and updates.</paragraph><paragraph title="14.1.9.R.02.">End Point Agents monitor traffic and apply security policies on applications, storage interfaces and data in real-time. Administrators actively block or monitor and log policy breaches. The End Point Agent can also create forensic monitoring to facilitate incident investigation.</paragraph><paragraph title="14.1.9.R.03.">End Point Agents can monitor user activity, such as the cut, copy, paste, print, print screen operations and copying data to external drives and other devices. &#xA0;The Agent can then apply policies to limit such activity.</paragraph><paragraph title="14.1.9.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Must" CID="1158">Agencies MUST ensure that for all servers and workstations:
a technical specification is agreed for each platform with specified controls;
a standard configuration created and updated for each operating system type and version;
system users do not have the ability to install or disable software without approval; and
installed software and operating system patching is up to date.
</paragraph><paragraph title="14.1.9.C.02." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="1159">Agencies SHOULD ensure that for all servers and workstations:
malware detection heuristics are set to a high level;
malware pattern signatures are checked for updates on at least a daily basis;
malware pattern signatures are updated as soon as possible after vendors make them available;&#xA0;
all disks and systems are regularly scanned for malicious code; and
the use of End Point Agents is considered.
</paragraph></block><block title="14.1.10. Default passwords and accounts"><paragraph title="14.1.10.R.01.">Default passwords and accounts for operating systems are often exploited by attackers as they are well documented in product manuals and can be easily checked in an automated manner with little effort required.</paragraph><paragraph title="14.1.10.C.01." classifications="Confidential, Secret, Top Secret" compliances="Must" CID="1162">Agencies MUST reduce potential vulnerabilities in their SOEs by:
removing unused accounts;
renaming or deleting default accounts; and
replacing default passwords before or during the installation process.

removing unused accounts;
renaming or deleting default accounts; and
replacing default passwords, before or during the installation process.
</paragraph></block><block title="14.1.11. Server separation"><paragraph title="14.1.11.R.01.">Servers with a high security risk can include Web, email, file, Internet Protocol Telephony (IPT) servers, Mobile Device Manager (MDM) servers and gateway components. It is important to clearly identify all services and connections to design a complete and secure server separation architecture. Refer also to Chapter 19 &#x2013; Gateway Security.</paragraph><paragraph title="14.1.11.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="1169">Where servers with a high security risk have connectivity to unsecure public networks, agencies SHOULD:
use appropriately designed and configured gateways;
consider the use of cross-domain solutions;
segment networks;
maintain effective functional segregation between servers allowing them to operate independently;
minimise communications between servers at both the network and file system level as appropriate; and
limit system users and programs to the minimum access needed to perform their duties.
</paragraph></block><block title="14.1.12. Characterisation"><paragraph title="14.1.12.R.01.">There are known techniques for defeating basic characterisations, therefore other methods of intrusion detection are also needed, particularly in situations where it is impractical to use a trusted environment for the generation of the characterisation data. Characterisation is very useful in post-intrusion forensic investigations where an infected disk can be compared to stored characterisation data in order to determine what files have been changed or introduced.</paragraph><paragraph title="14.1.12.R.02.">Characterisation is also directly related to business continuity and disaster recovery and is influenced by Business Impact Analyses and Risk Assessments. &#xA0;Grouping elements by business applications and setting priority and criticality of the elements to the business may assist in determining the most appropriate and useful characterisations.</paragraph><paragraph title="14.1.12.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="1185">Agencies SHOULD:
characterise all servers whose functions are critical to the agency, and those identified as being at a high security risk of compromise;
store the characterisation information securely off the server in a manner that maintains integrity;
update the characterisation information after every legitimate change to a system as part of the change control process;
as part of the agency&#x2019;s ongoing audit schedule, compare the stored characterisation information against current characterisation information to determine whether a compromise, or a legitimate but incorrectly completed system modification, has occurred;
perform the characterisation from a trusted environment rather than the standard operating system wherever possible; and
resolve any detected changes in accordance with the agency&#x2019;s information security incident management procedures.
</paragraph><paragraph title="14.1.12.C.02." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="1189">Agencies SHOULD use an Approved Cryptographic Algorithm to perform cryptographic checksums for characterisation purposes.</paragraph><paragraph title="14.1.12.C.03." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="1190">Agencies SHOULD consider characterisations in the context of a BCP or DRP and any related Business Impact Analyses and Risk Assessments.&#xA0;</paragraph></block><block title="14.1.13. Automated outbound connections by software"><paragraph title="14.1.13.R.01.">Applications that include beaconing functionality include those that initiate a connection to the vendor site over the Internet and inbound remote management.</paragraph><paragraph title="14.1.13.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="1193">Agencies SHOULD review all software applications to determine whether they attempt to establish any unauthorised or unplanned external connections.</paragraph><paragraph title="14.1.13.C.02." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="1194">If automated outbound connection functionality is included, agencies SHOULD make a business decision to determine whether to permit or deny these connections, including an assessment of the security risks involved in doing so.</paragraph><paragraph title="14.1.13.C.03." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="1195">If automated outbound connection functionality is included, agencies SHOULD consider the implementation of Data Loss Prevention (DLP) technologies.</paragraph></block><block title="14.1.14.

</paragraph><paragraph title="15.2.4.">Correct configuration of these features will help other mail servers authenticate the email they receive from your domains.&#xA0; It is important to note that DMARC is designed to protect against direct domain spoofing only.&#xA0; DMARC does not eliminate the need for additional forms of protection and analysis.&#xA0; It does, however, provide a way for participating senders and receivers to coordinate protective activities and streamline security processes.</paragraph><paragraph title="15.2.5.">It is also important to note that not all mail service providers enable DMARC, substituting the registration of a free email account as a validation of the user&#x2019;s email account instead.&#xA0; In this case the benefits and reporting associated with DMARC are not available.</paragraph></block></subsection><subsection title="Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance (DMARC)"><block title="Vocabulary"><paragraph title="15.2.6.">The terms &#x201C;none&#x201D;, &#x201C;reject&#x201D; and &#x201C;quarantine&#x201D; are used to describe DMARC actions based on policy modes.&#xA0; In this usage:
&#x201C;none&#x201D; means no action on the transmission or receipt of the email but continue to collect data and send reports;
By default, email under a &#x201C;reject&#x201D; policy setting is not delivered.&#xA0; &#x201C;Reject&#x201D; either:

refuses to accept non-compliant email, or
initially accepts the non-compliant email but prevents an email reaching the user.&#xA0; The acceptance process can generate a Delivery Status Notification (block/&#x201C;bounce&#x201D;) or simply delete/drop the email (block/delete);


&#x201C;quarantine&#x201D; prevents an email from reaching the user but safely storing it so it can be accessed if required (a potentially suspicious email and/or attachment subject to additional scrutiny).&#xA0; Quarantined items can be released following a review and release process.
</paragraph></block><block title="What is DMARC"><paragraph title="15.2.7.">Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance (DMARC) is an email authentication policy and reporting protocol that:
complements and unifies the existing validation checks performed by SPF and DKIM;
checks the stated origin of inbound emails using a combination of Sender Policy Framework (SPF) and DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM);
establishes a recipient email response for emails that fail the check;
requests recipient email services to report email sources and origins;
provides visibility over potentially illegitimate or fraudulent email.
</paragraph><paragraph title="15.2.8.">DMARC builds on SPF and DKIM protocols, adding links to the author (&#x201C;From:&#x201D;) domain name, published policies for recipient handling of authentication failures, and reporting from receivers to senders, in order to improve and monitor protection of the recipient domain from fraudulent email.</paragraph><paragraph title="15.2.9.">Most email services will check your DMARC record and send aggregated reports including details of all email the service received from the agency, and its origin.&#xA0; This assists in identifying if an individual within the agency is sending email inappropriately or if the agency domain is being spoofed.</paragraph></block><block title="Background, Reference and Implementation Guidance Sources"><paragraph title="15.2.10.">The IETF published RFC 7489, &#x201C;Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC)&#x201D; March 18th, 2015. RFC 7489.&#xA0; This is the principal standards guidance on the implementation and use of DMARC.&#xA0;Further guidance is available from The Global Cyber Alliance (GCA) - see References below.</paragraph></block><block title="Using DMARC"><paragraph title="15.2.11.">By establishing DMARC, SPF, and DKIM records in DNS, it's possible to advise email service providers which servers should be legitimately sending email from the agency&#x2019;s domain, and what action to take with mail received from any other domains.&#xA0;</paragraph><paragraph title="15.2.12.">In support of DMARC agencies must publish an SPF and a DKIM record.&#xA0; Agencies must also ensure emails agencies send (including those from third party services that send on behalf of the agency) have a DKIM signature that matches the signature in the DKIM record.</paragraph><paragraph title="15.2.13.">Agencies can choose to quarantine or reject messages that fail checks.&#xA0; More specifically:
Sender Policy Framework (SPF) is used to specify legitimate locations of servers which can send email for your domain;
DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) isn't supported by all mail servers, but if it is, it can be used to cryptographically sign outgoing mail sent by your servers to give email service providers further confidence that it's legitimate;
DMARC is used to inform email service providers what action they should take if SPF or DKIM (or both) validation fails;
One important aspect of DMARC is the action you ask email service providers to take when&#xA0;SPF or DKIM validation fails:

a policy of p=none means that they should allow non-compliant emails to be delivered but report the failure to the agency;
a policy of p=quarantine requests that they mark the email as spam;
a policy of p=reject requests the email service provider to refuse to deliver the email.


</paragraph><paragraph title="15.2.14.">Many organisations start with a policy of p=none, then modify the configuration to p=reject as confidence is gained in the accuracy of the configuration and in systems performance.&#xA0;</paragraph><paragraph title="15.2.15.">To notify other organisations of the use of DMARC agencies may publish a text record in their DNS similar to the following:
v=DMARC1;
p=quarantine;
pct=100;
rua=mailto:dmarc@agency.govt.nz (where agency is the name of the respective agency).
</paragraph><paragraph title="15.2.16.">This informs email recipients that:
you have a DMARC policy (v=DMARC1)
any messages that fail DMARC checks should be treated as spam (p=quarantine)
they should treat 100% of your messages this way (pct=100)
they should send reports of email received back to you (rua=mailto:dmarc@agency.govt.nz)
</paragraph><paragraph title="15.2.17.">It is not unusual to experience minor errors in syntax or other elements of DMARC configuration when first implementing DMARC.&#xA0; Some discussion on common problems, issues and solutions can be found on the DMARC website (see the References table below).</paragraph><paragraph title="15.2.18.">It is unwise for an agency to attempt to move to full implementation of DMARC until there is certainty that the configuration and implementation are stable and operating as intended.&#xA0; The following implementation outline is recommended by the GCA/DMARC organisation (see References below):
Deploy DKIM &amp; SPF;
Ensure mailers are correctly aligning the appropriate identifiers;
Publish a DMARC record with the &#x201C;none&#x201D; flag set for the policies, which requests data reports;
Analyse the data and modify mail streams as appropriate; and
Modify DMARC policy flags from &#x201C;none&#x201D; to &#x201C;quarantine&#x201D; to &#x201C;reject&#x201D; as experience dictates.
</paragraph></block><block title="DMARC Reporting"><paragraph title="15.2.19.">DMARC reporting provides information to assist an agency&#x2019;s IT system and email administrators.&#xA0; It can also provide an email asset inventory as well as providing data on spam, phishing and other email exploitation techniques.</paragraph><paragraph title="15.2.20.">DMARC can be configured to produce an aggregate report and a forensic report.&#xA0; In some cases agencies may also send reports to an external organisation such as a DMARC reporting service or a third-party IT service provider.&#xA0; Discretion should be used when providing such information to third parties in order to maintain security and privacy.</paragraph></block></subsection><subsection title="References"><paragraph title="15.2.21.">Further information on email security is available from the following sources:

Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance (DMARC)"><paragraph title="15.2.22.R.01.">Phishing and malware distribution attacks are common internet security threats.&#xA0; To limit the possibility of agency domains being used fraudulently (e.g. for spam or spear-phishing), agencies should implement:
A Sender Policy Framework (SPF);
DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM); and
Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting &amp; Conformance (DMARC) records.
</paragraph><paragraph title="15.2.22.R.02.">It is important to note that DMARC depends on the proper implementation of both SPF and DKIM.&#xA0; DMARC records are published in the DNS and provide guidance to the email receiver on actions to take when emails received do not conform to the published record.</paragraph><paragraph title="15.2.22.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="6019">Before implementing DMARC agencies SHOULD:
Create a DMARC policy;
List all domains, in particular those used for the sending and/or receiving of email;
Review the configuration of SPF and DKIM for all active domains and all published domains; and
Establish one or more monitored inboxes to receive DMARC reports.
</paragraph><paragraph title="15.2.22.C.02." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="6020">Agencies SHOULD enable DMARC for all email originating from or received by their domain(s), including:
sending domain owners SHOULD publish a DMARC record with a related DNS entry advising mail receivers of the characteristics of messages purporting to originate from the sender&#x2019;s domain;
received DMARC messages SHOULD be managed in accordance with the agency&#x2019;s published DMARC policy; and
agencies SHOULD produce failure reports and aggregate reports according to the agency&#x2019;s DMARC policies.
</paragraph><paragraph title="15.2.22.C.03." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="6021">Agencies SHOULD review DMARC reports on a regular basis and address any identified anomalies or security issues.</paragraph></block><block title="15.2.23. Filtering suspicious emails and attachments"><paragraph title="15.2.23.R.01.">The intent of blocking specific types of emails is to reduce the likelihood of phishing emails and emails or attachments containing malicious code entering the agency&#x2019;s networks.</paragraph><paragraph title="15.2.23.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="1745">Agencies SHOULD configure the following gateway filters:
inbound and outbound email, including any attachments, that contain:

malicious code;
content in conflict with the agency&#x2019;s email policy;
content that cannot be identified;
blacklisted or unauthorised filetypes; and

encrypted content, when that content cannot be inspected for malicious code or authenticated as originating from a trusted source;
emails addressed to internal email aliases with source addresses located from outside the domain; and
all emails arriving via an external connection where the source address uses an internal agency domain name.
</paragraph></block><block title="15.2.24. Active web addresses (URL) embedded in emails"><paragraph title="15.2.24.R.01.">Spoofed emails often contain an active (embedded) email address directing users to a malicious website in order to infect the workstation or agency systems with malicious code.</paragraph><paragraph title="15.2.24.R.02.">An effective defence is to strip and replace active addresses and hyperlinks with text only versions.</paragraph><paragraph title="15.2.24.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="1749">Email servers SHOULD be configured to strip active addresses and URL&#x2019;s and replace them with text only versions.</paragraph></block><block title="15.2.25. Preventing unmarked or inappropriately marked emails"><paragraph title="15.2.25.R.01.">Unmarked or inappropriately marked emails can be blocked at two points, the workstation or the email server. The email server is often the preferred location to block emails as it is a single location under the control of system administrators that can enforce the requirement for the entire network. In addition email servers can apply controls for emails generated by applications.</paragraph><paragraph title="15.2.25.R.02.">Whilst blocking at the email server is considered the most appropriate control there is an advantage in also blocking at the workstation. This approach adds an extra layer of security and will also reduce the likelihood of a data spill occurring on the email server.</paragraph><paragraph title="15.2.25.R.03.">For classified systems is it important to note that all emails containing classified information MUST be protectively marked. &#xA0;This requirement is outlined in Section 15.1 - Email Applications.</paragraph><paragraph title="15.2.25.C.01." classifications="Confidential, Secret, Top Secret" compliances="Must" CID="1754">Agencies MUST prevent unmarked and inappropriately marked emails being sent to intended recipients by blocking the email at the email server, originating workstation or both.</paragraph><paragraph title="15.2.25.C.02." classifications="Confidential, Secret, Top Secret" compliances="Must" CID="1755">Agencies MUST enforce protective marking of emails so that checking and filtering can take place.</paragraph><paragraph title="15.2.25.C.03." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="1756">Agencies SHOULD enforce protective marking of emails so that checking and filtering can take place.</paragraph></block><block title="15.2.26. Blocking of outbound emails"><paragraph title="15.2.26.R.01.">Blocking an outbound email with a valid protective marking or endorsement (e.g. NZEO) that indicates the email exceeds the classification of the communication path, stops data spills.</paragraph><paragraph title="15.2.26.R.02.">Agencies may remove protective markings from emails destined for private citizens and businesses once they have been approved for release from the agency&#x2019;s gateways.</paragraph><paragraph title="15.2.26.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Must" CID="1760">Agencies MUST configure systems to block any outbound emails with a protective marking or endorsement indicating that the content of the email exceeds the classification of the communication path.</paragraph><paragraph title="15.2.26.C.02." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="1761">Agencies SHOULD configure systems to log every occurrence of a blocked email.</paragraph></block><block title="15.2.27. Blocking of inbound emails"><paragraph title="15.2.27.R.01.">Blocking an inbound email with a valid protective marking that indicates the email or its attachment exceeds the classification the receiving system is accredited to process will prevent a data spill from occurring on the receiving system.</paragraph><paragraph title="15.2.27.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Must" CID="1764">Agencies MUST configure email systems to reject, log and report inbound emails with protective markings indicating that the content of the email exceeds the accreditation of the receiving system.</paragraph><paragraph title="15.2.27.C.02." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="1765">Agencies SHOULD notify the intended recipient of any blocked emails.</paragraph></block><block title="15.2.28. Undeliverable messages"><paragraph title="15.2.28.R.01.">Undeliverable or &#x201C;bounce&#x201D; emails are commonly sent by email servers to the original sender when the email cannot be delivered, often because the destination address is invalid. &#xA0;Because of the common spamming practice of spoofing sender addresses, this can result in a large amount of bounce emails being sent to an innocent third party. &#xA0;Sending bounces only to senders that can be verified via the Sender Policy Framework (SPF) or other trusted means avoids contributing to this problem and allows other government agencies and trusted parties to receive legitimate bounce messages. See also 15.2.15 - Sender Policy Framework.</paragraph><paragraph title="15.2.28.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="1768">Agencies SHOULD send notification of undeliverable, bounced or blocked emails to senders that can be verified via SPF or other trusted means.</paragraph></block><block title="15.2.29. Automatic forwarding of emails"><paragraph title="15.2.29.R.01.">Unsecured automatic forwarding of emails can pose a serious risk to the unauthorised disclosure of classified information, for example, a system user may set up a server-side rule to automatically forward all emails to a personal email account. This can result in classified emails being forwarded to the personal email account.</paragraph><paragraph title="15.2.29.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Must" CID="1771">Agencies MUST ensure that the requirements for blocking unmarked and outbound emails are also applied to automatically forwarded emails.</paragraph></block><block title="15.2.30. Open relay email servers"><paragraph title="15.2.30.R.01.">An open relay email server (or open mail relay) is a server that is configured to allow anyone on the Internet to send emails through the server. &#xA0;Such configurations are highly undesirable as they allow spammers and worms to exploit this functionality to send emails through the server.</paragraph><paragraph title="15.2.30.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="1774">Agencies SHOULD disable open email relaying so that email servers will only relay messages destined for the agency&#x2019;s domain(s) and those originating from within that domain.</paragraph></block><block title="15.2.31. Email server maintenance activities"><paragraph title="15.2.31.R.01.">Email servers perform a critical business function for many agencies; as such it is important that agencies perform regular email server auditing, security reviews and vulnerability analysis activities.</paragraph><paragraph title="15.2.31.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="1777">Agencies SHOULD perform regular email server auditing, security reviews and vulnerability analysis activities.</paragraph></block><block title="15.2.32. Centralised email gateways"><paragraph title="15.2.32.R.01.">Without a centralised email gateway it is exceptionally difficult to deploy Sender Policy Framework (SPF), DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) and outbound email protective markings verification.Attackers will almost invariably avoid using the primary email server when sending malicious emails. This is because the backup or alternative gateways are often poorly maintained with out-of-date blacklists and content filtering.</paragraph><paragraph title="15.2.32.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Must" CID="1780">Where an agency has system users that send email from outside the agency&#x2019;s network, an authenticated and encrypted channel MUST be configured to allow email to be sent via the centralised email gateway.</paragraph><paragraph title="15.2.32.C.02." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="1781">Agencies SHOULD route email through a centralised email gateway.</paragraph><paragraph title="15.2.32.C.03." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="1782">Where backup or alternative email gateways are in place, additional email gateways SHOULD be maintained at the same standard as the primary email gateway.</paragraph></block><block title="15.2.33. Transport Layer Security (TLS)"><paragraph title="15.2.33.R.01.">Email can be intercepted anywhere between the originating email server and the destination email server. Email transport between organisations and agencies is usually over the internet or other unsecured public infrastructure so it is important that email interception is carefully managed and suitable controls applied. One effective measure is to use TLS to encrypt the email traffic between email servers.</paragraph><paragraph title="15.2.33.R.02.">Enabling TLS on the originating and accepting email server will defeat passive attacks on the network, with the exception of cryptanalysis against email traffic. &#xA0;TLS encryption between email servers will not interfere with email content filtering schemes. &#xA0;Email servers will remain compatible with other email servers as IETF&#x2019;s RFC 3207 specifies the encryption as opportunistic</paragraph><paragraph title="15.2.33.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Must" CID="1786">Agencies MUST enable opportunistic TLS encryption as defined in IETF&#x2019;s RFC 3207 on email servers that make incoming or outgoing email connections over public infrastructure.</paragraph><paragraph title="15.2.33.C.02." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="1787">Agencies SHOULD implement TLS between email servers where significant volumes of classified information are passed via email to other agencies.</paragraph></block><block title="15.2.34. Sender Policy Framework (SPF)"><paragraph title="15.2.34.R.01.">The Sender Policy Framework (SPF) is an open standard specifying a technical method to prevent sender address forgery.An SPF-protected domain is less attractive to spammers and phishers because the forged e-mails are more likely to be caught in spam filters which check the SPF record. Because an SPF-protected domain is less attractive as a spoofed address, it is less likely to be blacklisted by spam filters and so is less disruptive to email traffic.</paragraph><paragraph title="15.2.34.R.02.">Having a proper Sender Policy Framework (SPF) record increases the chances people will get emails you send. &#xA0;Without one, your email has a greater chance of being marked as Spam.</paragraph><paragraph title="15.2.34.R.03.">SPF and alternatives such as Sender ID aid in the detection of spoofed email server address domains. &#xA0;The SPF record specifies a list of IP addresses or domains that are allowed to send mail from a specific domain. &#xA0;If the email server that transmitted the email is not in the list, the verification fails (there are a number of different fail types available).</paragraph><paragraph title="15.2.34.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Must" CID="1792">Agencies MUST:
specify mail servers using SPF or Sender ID; and&#xA0;
mark, block or identify incoming emails that fail SPF checks for notification to the email recipient.

Something you have (preferably NOT the device itself but a SEPARATE authentication device such as a token, RFID card or smartcard). This is also known as the possession factor;
Something you know such as a PIN, One-Time Password (OTP), reusable password, pattern or other component of a standard authentication mechanism. This is also described as the knowledge factor;
Something you are (biometrics of various types). This is also described as the inherence factor.
</paragraph><paragraph title="16.1.10.">Commonly used two factor authentication schemes are combinations of physical presence, a token and a PIN/Password. &#xA0;Biometrics are less commonly used on mobile or remote systems.</paragraph></block><block title="Software Tokens"><paragraph title="16.1.11.">Software Tokens, Soft Tokens or &#x201C;softokens&#x201D; are typically applications that run on mobile devices such as smart phones, tablets, laptops other workstations. They are sometimes also known as &#x201C;virtual tokens&#x201D;. When soft tokens are used the device itself then becomes the &#x201C;possession factor&#x201D;. Functionality may include:
Transfer between devices by the user.
Use of Quick Response (QR) codes to facilitate deployment.
Manages international time zones changes when travelling.
</paragraph><paragraph title="16.1.12.">The soft token (secret) is vulnerable to any attacker that can gain full access to the device through theft, loss or download of malware. &#xA0;This is not as secure as a separate hardware token which is more resistant to attack and tampering.</paragraph></block><block title="Passwords and Password storage"><paragraph title="16.1.13.">Password length and composition (character type) has been found to be a primary factor in characterizing password strength [Strength][Composition]. Passwords that are too short yield to brute force attacks as well as to dictionary attacks using words and commonly chosen passwords.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.1.14.">The minimum password length that should be required depends to a large extent on the threat model being addressed.&#xA0; Online attacks where the attacker attempts to log in by guessing the password can be mitigated by limiting the rate of login attempts permitted. In order to prevent an attacker (or a persistent claimant with poor typing skills) from easily inflicting a denial-of-service attack on the subscriber by making many incorrect guesses, passwords need to be complex enough that the rate limiting does not occur after a modest number of erroneous attempts, but does occur before there is a significant chance of a successful guess.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.1.15.">Offline attacks are sometimes possible when one or more hashed passwords are obtained by the attacker through a database breach.&#xA0; The ability of the attacker to determine one or more users' passwords depends on the way in which the password is stored.&#xA0; Commomly, passwords are salted with a random value and hashed, preferably using a computationally expensive algorithm.&#xA0; Even with such measures, the current ability of attackers to compute many billions of hashes per second with no rate limiting requires passwords intended to resist such attacks to be orders of magnitude more complex than those that are expected to resist only online attacks.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.1.16.">Users should be encouraged to make their passwords as lengthy as they want, within reason.&#xA0; A reasonable upper limit is 64 characters.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.1.17.">Since the size of a hashed password is independent of its length, there is no reason not to permit the use of lengthy passwords (or passphrases) if the user wishes.&#xA0; Extremely long passwords (perhaps megabytes in length) could conceivably require excessive processing time to hash, so it is reasonable to have some limit.</paragraph></block><block title="Password Character Set Limitations"><paragraph title="16.1.18.">Limitations set on credential or password length or on the use of special characters can facilitate brute-force attacks.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.1.19.">A brute-force attack is a trial-and-error method used to discover information such as a user password, a personal identification number (PIN), or to decrypt encrypted data.&#xA0; Automation can be used to generate a large number of consecutive guesses.&#xA0; Similar methods are used by security analysts to test an organisation's system security, often described as penetration testing.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.1.20.">Organisations should not permit the use of short or no-length passwords, restrict the use of character sets or apply encoding restrictions on entry or storage of credentials.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.1.21.">Password length, character variation and use of symbols, numbers and special characters including emoticons will increase the resistance of hash values to attack.&#xA0; These practices will assist in limiting a variety of malicious attacks on IT systems.</paragraph></block><block title="Hashing"><paragraph title="16.1.22.">Hashing is a one-way function where data is mapped to a fixed-length value.&#xA0; It also protects a password by producing ciphertext.&#xA0; Contrast hashing with encryption is a two-way function where the data can be encrypted and decrypted.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.1.23.">In general, applications use secure hashing algorithms for:
Password Protection;
Integrity checking: e.g. a tamper-evident seal for a file (checksum);
Authentication: e.g. Digital signatures, Hashed Message Authentication Codes (HMAC) and pseudo-random number generation (PRNG).
</paragraph><paragraph title="16.1.24.">Very large passwords can create system performance issues and choke points.&#xA0; Password hashing reduces all passwords to a fixed length, improving efficiency and reducing the volume of credential traffic.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.1.25.">Approved hash functions have the following characteristics:
One-way: It is computationally infeasible to find any input that maps to any pre-specified output; and
Collision Resistant: It is computationally infeasible to find any two distinct inputs that map to the same output.
Refer also to section 17.4 - Transport Layer Security.</paragraph></block><block title="Salting"><paragraph title="16.1.26.">Refer to 17.2.13 for discussion on the use of salts; and 17.2.25 for the related controls.</paragraph></block><block title="Key Stretching"><paragraph title="16.1.27.">Key stretching is a technique of slowing the hash function as a means of discouraging attacks (making the time spent not worthwhile while increasing the length of the detection window).&#xA0; Typically this is achieved through a high iteration count in the hashing process, in some cases as high as 10,000 iterations.&#xA0; It is important to note the stretching of the key does not alter the entropy (randomness) of the key-space, rather it complicates the method of computing the stretched key.However note the time versus security trade-off here as key stretching comes at the cost of more time spent in validating user connection requests. This is particularly apparent for transactional or high user-volume websites and networks with large numbers of users.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.1.28.">However, note the time versus security trade o&#xFB00; here as key stretching comes at the cost of more time spent in validating user connection requests.&#xA0; This is particularly apparent for transactional or high user-volume websites and networks with large numbers of users.</paragraph></block></subsection><subsection title="References"><paragraph title="16.1.29.">Additional information relating to Access Control and User Authentication can be found at:

System user identification"><paragraph title="16.1.32.R.01.">Having uniquely identifiable system users ensures accountability.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.1.32.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Must" CID="1829">Agencies MUST ensure that all system users are:
uniquely identifiable; and
authenticated on each occasion that access is granted to a system.
</paragraph></block><block title="16.1.33. Shared accounts"><paragraph title="16.1.33.R.01.">Sharing passwords and UserIDs (credentials) may be convenient but invariably hampers efforts to identify a specific user and attribute actions to a specific person or system. While agencies and users find convenience in sharing credentials, doing so is highly risky. Shared credentials can defeat accountability and the attribution and non-repudiation principles of access control. This is particularly important where administrative access to networks and servers or access to classified information is provided through shared credentials.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.1.33.C.01." classifications="Top Secret" compliances="Must Not" CID="1832">Agencies MUST NOT use shared credentials to access accounts.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.1.33.C.02." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should Not" CID="1833">Agencies SHOULD NOT use shared credentials to access accounts.</paragraph></block><block title="16.1.34. System user identification for shared accounts"><paragraph title="16.1.34.R.01.">Agencies may have a compelling business reason for the use of shared accounts. These may include Anonymous, Guest and Temporary Employee (such relieving a receptionist) credentials. It may not be possible to attribute the use of such accounts to a specific person.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.1.34.R.02.">As shared accounts are non user-specific, agencies will need to determine an appropriate method of attributing actions undertaken by such accounts to specific personnel. &#xA0;For example, a logbook may be used to document the date and time that a person takes responsibility for using a shared account and the actions logged against the account by the system.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.1.34.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Must" CID="1837">If agencies choose to allow shared, non user-specific accounts they MUST ensure that an independent means of determining the identification of the system user is implemented.</paragraph></block><block title="16.1.35. Methods for system user identification and authentication"><paragraph title="16.1.35.R.01.">A personal identification number is typically short in length and employs a small character set, making it susceptible to brute force attacks.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.1.35.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Must Not" CID="1840">Agencies MUST NOT use a numerical password (or personal identification number) as the sole method of authenticating a system user to access a system.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.1.35.C.02." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="1841">Agencies SHOULD ensure that they combine the use of multiple methods when identifying and authenticating system users.</paragraph></block><block title="16.1.36. Protecting stored authentication information"><paragraph title="16.1.36.R.01.">Limiting the storage of unprotected authentication information reduces the possibility of an attacker finding and using the information to access a system under the guise of a valid system user.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.1.36.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Must Not" CID="1844">Agencies MUST NOT allow storage of unprotected authentication information that grants system access, or decrypts an encrypted device, to be located on, or with the system or device, to which the authentication information grants access.</paragraph></block><block title="16.1.37. Protecting authentication data in transit"><paragraph title="16.1.37.R.01.">Secure transmission of authentication information will reduce the risk of interception and subsequent use of the authentication information by an attacker to access a system under the guise of a valid system user.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.1.37.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Must" CID="1847">Agencies MUST ensure that system authentication data is protected when in transit on agency networks or All-of-Government systems.</paragraph></block><block title="16.1.38. Hashing"><paragraph title="16.1.38.R.01.">Hashing is a means of protecting stored passwords or other authentication data by cryptographically converting the password to fixed length ciphertext.&#xA0; This protects against incidents where an unsanctioned copy of the password or authentication database has been made, exported or the database otherwise compromised.&#xA0; Approved cryptographic protocols are discussed in&#xA0;Chapter 17 - Cryptography. See also section&#xA0;17.2 - Approved Cryptographic Algorithms&#xA0;for discussion on the use of salts to strengthen the cryptographic resistance of a hash.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.1.38.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="6553">Password and other authentication data SHOULD be hashed before storage using an approved cryptographic protocol and algorithm.</paragraph></block><block title="16.1.39. Identification of foreign nationals"><paragraph title="16.1.39.R.01.">Where systems contain NZEO or other nationalities releasability marked or protectively marked information, and foreign nationals have access to such systems, it is important that agencies implement appropriate security measures to assist in identifying users that are foreign nationals. &#xA0;Such measures will assist in preventing the release of sensitive information to those not authorised to access it.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.1.39.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Must" CID="1850">Where systems contain NZEO or other nationalities releasability marked or protectively marked information, agencies MUST provide a mechanism that allows system users and processes to identify users who are foreign nationals, including seconded foreign nationals.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.1.39.C.02." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="1851">Agencies using NZEO systems SHOULD ensure that identification includes specific nationality for all foreign nationals, including seconded foreign nationals.</paragraph></block><block title="16.1.40. Password selection policy"><paragraph title="16.1.40.R.01.">Passwords are the primary authentication mechanism for almost all information systems and are fundamental part of access and authentication processes and mechanisms. &#xA0;While there are some limitations in the use of passwords, they remain the most cost effective means available with current technology.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.1.40.R.02.">Passwords are subject to three principal groups of risks:
Intentional password sharing;
Password theft, loss or compromise; and
Password guessing and cracking.
</paragraph><paragraph title="16.1.40.R.03.">Associated with these risk groups are four principal methods of attacking passwords:
Interactive attempts including password guessing, brute force attacks or some knowledge of the user or agency.
Obtaining the password through social engineering or phishing.
Compromising the password through oversight, observation, use of keyloggers, cameras etc.
Cracking through network traffic interception, misconfiguration, malware, data capture etc. For example a simple eight-letter password can today be brute-forced in minutes by software freely available on the Internet.
</paragraph><paragraph title="16.1.40.R.04.">Password controls are designed to manage these risks and attack methods using the controls specified in this section. For example, passwords with at least ten characters utilising upper and lower case, numbers and special characters have a much greater resistance to brute force attacks. When use in combination with controls such as password history and regular password change, passwords can present high resistance to known attack methods.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.1.40.C.01." classifications="Confidential, Secret, Top Secret" compliances="Must" CID="1857">Agencies MUST implement a password policy enforcing:
a minimum password length of ten characters, consisting of at least three of the following character sets:

lowercase characters (a-z);
uppercase characters (A-Z);
digits (0-9); and
punctuation and special characters.

</paragraph><paragraph title="16.1.40.C.02." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="1858">Agencies SHOULD implement a password policy enforcing either:
a minimum password length of 16 characters with no complexity requirement; or
a minimum password length of ten characters, consisting of at least three of the following character sets:

lowercase characters (a-z);
uppercase characters (A-Z);
digits (0-9); and
punctuation and special characters.

</paragraph></block><block title="16.1.41. Password management"><paragraph title="16.1.41.R.01.">Changing a password at least every 90 days will limit the time period in which a disclosed password could be used by an unauthorised system user.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.1.41.R.02.">Preventing a system user from changing their password more than once a day will stop the system user from immediately changing their password back to their old password.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.1.41.R.03.">Checking passwords for compliance with the password selection policy will allow system administrators to detect unsafe password selection and ensure that the system user changes it.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.1.41.R.04.">Requiring a system user to change a password on account reset will ensure that the system user has a password known only to that user and is more easily remembered.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.1.41.R.05.">Disallowing predictable reset passwords will reduce the security risk of brute force attacks and password guessing attacks.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.1.41.R.06.">Using different passwords when resetting multiple accounts will prevent a system user whose account has been recently reset from logging into another such account.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.1.41.R.07.">Disallowing passwords from being reused within eight changes will prevent a system user from cycling between a small subset of passwords.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.1.41.R.08.">Disallowing sequential passwords will reduce the security risk of an attacker easily guessing a system user&#x2019;s next password based on their knowledge of the system user&#x2019;s previous password.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.1.41.C.01." classifications="Confidential, Secret, Top Secret" compliances="Must" CID="1868">Agencies MUST:
ensure that passwords are changed at least every 90 days;
prevent system users from changing their password more than once a day;
check passwords for compliance with their password selection policy where the system cannot be configured to enforce complexity requirements; and
force the system user to change an expired password on initial logon or if reset.

</paragraph></block><block title="16.1.42. Resetting passwords"><paragraph title="16.1.42.R.01.">To reduce the likelihood of social engineering attacks aimed at service desks, agencies will need to ensure that system users provide sufficient evidence to verify their identity when requesting a password reset for their system account. This evidence could be in the form of:
the system user physically presenting themselves and their security pass to service desk personnel who then reset their password;
physically presenting themselves to a known colleague who uses an approved online tool to reset their password; or
establishing their identity by responding correctly to a number of questions before resetting their own password.
</paragraph><paragraph title="16.1.42.R.02.">Issuing complex reset passwords maintains the security of the user account during the reset process. &#xA0;This can also present an opportunity to demonstrate the selection of strong passwords.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.1.42.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Must" CID="1875">Agencies MUST ensure system users provide sufficient evidence to verify their identity when requesting a password reset for their system account.</paragraph></block><block title="16.1.43.

</paragraph></block><block title="Background"><paragraph title="16.4.4.">Privileged Access Management (PAM) &#x2013; sometimes also described as Privileged Account Management, refers to a set of processes and tools for granting, controlling, monitoring, and auditing privileged access.&#xA0;</paragraph><paragraph title="16.4.5.">A Privileged Account is a user account with high levels of access to systems, devices and data.&#xA0; Privileged accounts may, for example, be able to install or remove software, delete data, upgrade operating systems, or modify system or application configurations.&#xA0; They may also have access to data that is not normally accessible to standard users.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.4.6.">Privileged Accounts invariably have direct or indirect access to most or all IT assets of an agency or organisation.&#xA0; When used improperly or maliciously, privileged accounts represent a significant security threat to operations, often exposing sensitive data, impeding operations or damaging IT systems.&#xA0; Any compromise of these accounts is, therefore, a significant business, operational and reputational risk.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.4.7.">Risks associated with privileged accounts have increased in recent years with the expansion of endpoints and use of new technologies including Cloud, Internet of Things (IoT) and the rapid and significant increase in remote and work from home following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.4.8.">Managing, controlling, monitoring and reviewing privileged access is fundamental to mitigating the risks posed by insider and external threats, privilege escalation threats, preventing unauthorised data access and data breaches, and meeting compliance requirements.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.4.9.">There are many types of privileged access including:
Root, Domain and other Administrator accounts are typically used for installing, updating and removing software, changing configurations and administering system passwords.
Service Accounts, which may include local or domain accounts, are typically used for running processes, such as web servers, database servers, and application servers.&#xA0; These may also include the ability to change passwords.
Emergency Accounts, sometimes referred to as &#x201C;DRP&#x201D;, &#x201C;firecall&#x201D; or &#x201C;breakglass&#x201D; accounts.&#xA0; While access to emergency accounts normally requires managerial approval as a security measure, they are typically an inefficient manual process with limited auditability.
System or Application Accounts are characteristically used by devices and systems for running operating system components and owning related files.
</paragraph><paragraph title="16.4.10.">Traditional administrative or management solutions are typically based on strong password management.&#xA0; Modern systems, especially in a cloud environment, require a more structured and robust means of access control and management.&#xA0; This should include the use of Multi-Factor Authentication (See Section 16.7 - Multi-factor Authentication) to provide access to Privileged Accounts.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.4.11.">In secure environments, privileged accounts should be reserved for network and system administrators to manage the access to and oversight of sensitive information and resources in support of normal agency or organisational operations.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.4.12.">The characteristics and capability of privileged accounts are described at 16.3.3.&#xA0; It is important to note that systems themselves, as well as human users, may have privileged account access.&#xA0; As such it is important to clearly and individually identify all real persons, systems and devices with privileged account access.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.4.13.">Access accounts or channels may have the following characteristics:
Regular access channels&#x2014;protected channels that are subject to standard IT controls;
Privileged access channels (PACs)&#x2014; channels that might circumvent regular controls but are deemed necessary and legitimate operational channels for reasons of practicality or cost;
Unintended channels not demanded by any technical or business requirement and represent a vulnerability.
</paragraph></block><block title="Attacks on Privileged Accounts"><paragraph title="16.4.14.">Privileged accounts frequently allow unrestricted access the IT infrastructure, often including data residing on those systems.&#xA0; The very high level of access and capability associated with privileged accounts makes them a prime target for external attackers and malicious insiders.&#xA0; A compromise of a privileged account can be extremely damaging and may even cripple systems, such as in ransomware attacks.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.4.15.">Compromised privileged accounts represent one of the largest security vulnerabilities an organisation can face today.&#xA0; A compromise will allow attackers to take full control of an organisation&#x2019;s IT infrastructure, disable security controls, steal confidential information, commit financial fraud and disrupt operations.&#xA0; Stolen, abused or misused privileged credentials are identified in a very high proportion of successful breaches.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.4.16.">Common attack methods may include:
Probes and scans;
endpoint targeting;
System and design vulnerability exploitation;
Social engineering (including phishing, email spoofing, etc); and
Malware implants.
</paragraph></block><block title="Governance and Control"><paragraph title="16.4.17.">Privileged Accounts are frequently used to deploy and maintain IT systems and necessarily exist in nearly every connected device, server, database, and application.&#xA0; Privileged Accounts may extend beyond an agency-controlled IT infrastructure to include, for example, employee-managed corporate social media accounts.&#xA0; Most agencies and other organisations can typically have many more privileged accounts than employees, sometimes as many as two or three times the number of employees.&#xA0; It is not unusual for some privileged accounts to be unidentified, overlooked, unmanaged, and therefore unprotected.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.4.18.">Governance ensures that privileged accounts are properly approved, controlled, monitored and decommissioned throughout their entire lifecycle.&#xA0; A PAM Policy defines the roles, policies and mechanisms for access requests, as well as the workflow for privileged access approvals and delivery.&#xA0; Monitoring and auditing ensure that account permissions and usage remain appropriate over time.&#xA0; PAM governance is a fundamental part of IT Governance as it can influence other IT security systems, such as identity and access management systems.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.4.19.">In order to support strong IT Governance, it is vital that security efforts are coordinated and technology investment managed.&#xA0; This includes the integration of PAM into the Information Security Policy, Systems Architecture, IT Security Strategy and Risk Management Plan. The sensitivity of data and operations should be assessed by undertaking an impact assessment.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.4.20.">Underpinning any PAM is the principle of enforcement of least privilege.&#xA0; This is defined as the minimisation of access rights and permissions for users, accounts, applications, systems, devices and computing processes to the absolute minimum necessary in order to perform routine, authorised activities and maintain the safe and secure operation of agency or organisational systems.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.4.21.">Enforcing the principle of least privilege assists agencies in minimising their systems attack surface, supporting audit and compliance though improved visibility.&#xA0; This also can reduce risk, complexity, and costs for agencies.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.4.22.">Provision of unnecessary system privileges or data access rights will magnify the impact of misuse or compromise of that users account and can even be devastating. &#xA0;Account privileges should be established to provide a reasonable but minimal level of system privileges and rights needed in order to support the purpose and role. &#xA0;The granting of elevated or excessive system privileges should be carefully controlled and managed.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.4.23.">Risks associated with access to privileged accounts include:
Misuse of privileges;
Increased attacker capability;
Circumventing established security and oversight controls;
Severe system disruption or failure; and
Significant data compromise and/or loss.
</paragraph><paragraph title="16.4.24.">The principles of PAM controls are to:
Establish and maintain an inventory of privileged accounts;
Assess the risk(s) of each privileged access channel;
Enforce the principle of least privilege;
Use two-factor or Multi-Factor Authentication for access to Privileged Accounts;
Minimise access to only essential activities;
Minimise the number of privileged access channels;
Ensure each channel and user can be uniquely identified (prevent or minimise sharing of credentials, particularly with accounts such as &#x201C;root&#x201D; or &#x201C;admin&#x201D;);
Ensure operational systems have access to compiled code only;
Ensure source code is created, managed and stored on non-operational systems only;
Restrict access to source code (deny-by-default);
Log all access to source code including the detection, evaluation, recording and termination of privileged access channels;
Ensure all logs are periodically reviewed;
Ensure strong and strict change control procedures are implemented;
Ensure the authorisation, activation and deactivation of privileged access channels is strictly enforced; and
Regularly audit and review PAM controls.
</paragraph><paragraph title="16.4.25.">It is also important to define all privileged accounts used by an agency or by other organisations, particularly where outsource arrangements are in place. &#xA0;It is fundamental for robust security to identify and record the business functions, related data, systems and access privileges.&#xA0; This is particularly important for agencies that create, store and process classified data.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.4.26.">Without a comprehensive privileged accounts inventory, agencies and other organisations may overlook &#x201C;backdoor&#x201D; accounts which allow users to bypass proper controls and auditing. &#xA0;These may have been created during system development, by malicious insiders or by external attackers.&#xA0; Such unregistered accounts may be undetected for months or even years and can create a means of unauthorised and unmonitored access.&#xA0; Such accounts may also be used to erase activity logs to avoid detection.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.4.27.">A privileged access inventory should include a description of the IT system, information asset, privilege description, users and risk classification.&#xA0; This is essential information for assessing risk, the determining of controls and for identifying and managing use and misuse.&#xA0; Of note are:
Local or Domain Server Admin accounts;
Domain Admin accounts that typically control Active Directory users;
System Admin accounts that manage databases;
Root accounts that manage Unix/Linux platforms;
Accounts that run and manage Windows applications, services, and scheduled tasks;
IIS application pools (.NET applications);
Networking equipment accounts that give access to firewalls, routers, switches, session border controllers, gateways and other similar devices, whether physical or virtual.
</paragraph><paragraph title="16.4.28.">Privileged Access Management systems provide many of the capabilities and controls briefly described above and can facilitate PAM, as well as supporting strong IT Governance.</paragraph></block></subsection><subsection title="References"><paragraph title="16.4.29.">Additional information relating to Privileged Account and access management, including some policy examples, can be found at:

Actions may include the immediate suspension of credentials.&#xA0; Revocation may follow depending on the outcome of the investigation.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.4.33.R.02.">The privileged access credentials for staff and other users (such as authorised contractors) should be suspended or revoked as part of exit procedures when staff leave the agency and when other users no longer undertake duties for the agency.&#xA0; This ensures the numbers of credentials are controlled, credentials are revoked when no longer required for operational purposes and that the risk of unauthorised activities and access is minimised.&#xA0;</paragraph><paragraph title="16.4.33.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Must" CID="6852">Agencies MUST establish robust credential suspension and revocation procedures as part of the agency&#x2019;s Privileged Access Management (PAM) policy.</paragraph></block><block title=" Privileged Account, Rights and Credential Inventory"><paragraph title="16.4.34.R.01.">Account and credential &#x201C;sprawl&#x201D;

Chapter 7 &#x2013; Information Security Incidents;
Section 9.1 &#x2013; Information Security Awareness and Training ;
Section 16.1 &#x2013; Identification, Authentication and Passwords;
Section 16.2 &#x2013; System Access and Passwords;

Section 16.4 &#x2013; Privileged Access Management; and
Chapter 17 - Cryptography.
</paragraph></block><block title="Background"><paragraph title="16.7.4.">Authentication is a key element of security that provides confirmation of the identity of all parties to a transaction.&#xA0; In this context a transaction may include browsing, financial operations and all types of data access, creation, copying and deletion.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.7.5.">Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is a security system that verifies a user&#x2019;s identity by requiring multiple credentials, which may be of the same factor or type.&#xA0; Initial authentication often requires a username and password followed by a requirement for other (additional) credentials.&#xA0; It is important to recognise that MFA authentication is not necessarily the same as Two-Factor Authentication or Dual-Factor Authentication. &#xA0;MFA can enable, for example, valid users&#x2019; access to permit credential reset, even if they are using a username and password that may have been compromised.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.7.6.">Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is a strong defence and deterrent against many credential attacks, including brute-force, credential stuffing and password spraying attacks.&#xA0; It also defends against social engineering attacks seeking user credentials.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.7.7.">Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) incorporates Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), which is also briefly discussed in Section 16.1 &#x2013; Identification, Authentication and Passwords.&#xA0; 2FA requires two elements from any of the three factors of authentication and with the second factor from a different group to the first factor selected.&#xA0; These factors or groups are:
Something you have (preferably NOT the device itself but a SEPARATE authentication device such as a token, RFID card or smartcard).&#xA0; This is also known as the possession or ownership factor;
Something you know such as a PIN, One-Time Password (OTP), reusable password, pattern or other component of a standard authentication mechanism.&#xA0; This is also described as the knowledge factor;
Something you are (physical characteristics or biometrics of various types).&#xA0; This is also described as the inherence factor.
</paragraph><paragraph title="16.7.8.">MFA is frequently used where the assurance provided by username and password is inadequate.&#xA0; Additional authenticators increase attack resistance and reduce risk of unauthorised access. Additional authentication also assists in managing Privileged Access (refer to Section 16.4 &#x2013; Privileged Access Management).</paragraph><paragraph title="16.7.9.">MFA is most effective when knowledge, possession, and inherence authentication factors are used as compensating factors for other authentication weaknesses.&#xA0; This is discussed in more detail in 16.7.16 below.&#xA0; Using MFA increases attack resistance by increasing the difficulty of obtaining all necessary authenticators.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.7.10.">It is important to use a variety of factors to strengthen attack resistance in order to increase confidence levels in the chosen authentication system.&#xA0; For example, using a second factor from the knowledge group is less effective as passwords are inherently part of the knowledge group.&#xA0; Knowledge groups are most exposed to attack and compromise through social engineering.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.7.11.">To maximise the effectiveness and security of any Multi-Factor Authentication construct, the authentication service should be dedicated, hardened and isolated within the network&#x2019;s security architecture.</paragraph></block><block title="SMS"><paragraph title="16.7.12.">There are several known vulnerabilities in SMS which may make it unsuitable and unsafe for authentication purposes.&#xA0; Vulnerabilities include:
Hackers have been able to mislead and persuade carriers and service providers into porting a phone number to a new device through a SIM swap.&#xA0; This can often be achieved with minimal personal information such as your phone number, date of birth, full name, the last four digits of your bank card access number, bank account number, mobile device number, Social Security number or similar information.&#xA0; Users often store bank cards with their mobile device so if the device is stolen or simply accessed temporarily, this data can also be accessed.&#xA0; Once the phone number has been redirected, physical access to your device is no longer required.&#xA0; Any SMS codes are then subject to compromise.
If text messages are synched with or duplicated on a laptop, tablet or other personal device, then SMS are vulnerable if the device used by another person or if the device is stolen.
There are vulnerabilities in mobile telecommunication infrastructure in what's described as a SS7 (Signalling System 7) attack.&#xA0; An SS7 attack is an exploit that takes advantage of a weakness in the design of SS7 which can enable data theft, eavesdropping, text interception and location tracking.&#xA0; SS7 is a protocol dating from the mid-1970&#x2019;s and almost all telecommunication service providers have now implemented security measures to counter SS7 exploits.&#xA0; Social engineering remains a risk.
</paragraph></block><block title="Key Benefits"><paragraph title="16.7.13.">The principal benefits of MFA include:
Strengthened security and credential protection;
Streamlined user access;
Reduced administrative overhead;
Increased security visibility; and
Improved compliance.
</paragraph></block><block title="Adaptive Authentication"><paragraph title="16.7.14.">Adaptive Authentication varies the level or degree of authentication required where an unusual authentication request occurs.&#xA0; For example, out of normal hours, from an unusual geolocation, from an unrecognised device, from an unrecognised IP address and so on.&#xA0; When an unusual authentication request is received, Adaptive Authentication may request additional credentials such as a one-time code provided to a known mobile phone number. &#xA0;Some risk factors that may trigger Adaptive Authentication include:
The location of the access request such as such as a caf&#xE9;, airport or home;
The time of the access request such as like late at night, over weekends or during normal working hours;
The type of device, such as a smartphone, tablet, laptop or unrecognised device;
The type of connection, for example, a public network such as the internet, or a VPN or some other private network; and
A request for access to privileged accounts.
&#xA0;</paragraph><paragraph title="16.7.15.">Adaptive authentication includes what is sometimes described as transaction identification where known characteristics are compared to the transaction or access request.&#xA0; For example a known location or common access request.&#xA0; If known characteristics do not match then additional authentication steps may be indicated or required.</paragraph></block><block title="Client-Side Authentication"><paragraph title="16.7.16.">Client-side authentication originates from the user&#x2019;s device such as laptop, mobile phone, tablet or home computer.&#xA0; These devices may provide a variety of authentication methods including:
Inherence factor/Biometric:

Fingerprint scans;
Facial recognition;
Voice command/recognition;
Iris scans;
Keystroke dynamics;


Knowledge factor:

PIN codes;
Pattern codes;


Possession factor:

</paragraph><paragraph title="16.7.17.">It is important to note that some biometric and other measures, for example fingerprints, are susceptible to attacks such as spoofing.&#xA0; To combat these biometric attacks secondary measures are also required, for example pulse-sensing in addition to fingerprint detection in order to ensure the fingerprint presentation is a live person. &#xA0;Clearly not all secondary measures are fully effective in themselves and multiple secondary measures may be required for high risk/high value authorisation requests.</paragraph></block><block title="Single-User and Multi-User Authorisation"><paragraph title="16.7.18.">Single-User authorisationinvolves prompting the account holder to authorise an action being taken on his behalf.&#xA0; For example, single-user authorisation can even prevent fraud as it occurs in a user-friendly manner.&#xA0; Instead of calling the customer to verify the legitimacy of a purchase, credit card companies could request customer authentication for an on-line purchase by sending an authorisation request to the customer through an alternate channel such as a mobile phone.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.7.19.">Multi-User authorisation usually requires multiple and separate authentications (usually people) in order to authorise a transaction or event, such as establishing an account.&#xA0; This system supports the &#x201C;separation of duties&#x201D; concept common in accounting transactions or other high risk activities.&#xA0; Another example is a password change for a privileged account.&#xA0; Multiuser authorisation may also assess risk indicators and context (e.g. time, location) to select the authentication components and requirements.</paragraph></block><block title="Multi-Step Authentication"><paragraph title="16.7.20.">Multi-step Authentication is a design and architectural approach to control access to resources by sequentially using multiple authentication verifiers. &#xA0;Each authentication step grants access to increasingly privileged areas of the system until access to the desired resources is reached (refer also to 16.4 &#x2013; Privileged Access Management). &#xA0;Multi-Step Authentication can be activated by risk-based &#x201C;triggers&#x201D; where risk factors are identified.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.7.21.">Multi-step Authentication may require only one authentication factor or mechanism, so it is important not to confuse Multi-Step Authentication with Multi-Factor Authentication.&#xA0; Multi-Step Authentication may not be as secure as MFA and cannot be an appropriate substitute for MFA.&#xA0; A key risk is repeated use of a single authentication factor.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.7.22.">It is also worth noting, however, that Multi-Step combined with Multi-Factor Authentication is a strong architectural security construct, particularly when separate authentication factors are required at each step when accessing privileged accounts.</paragraph></block><block title="Perfect Forward Secrecy"><paragraph title="16.7.23.">In addition to the encryption protocols and algorithms discussed in Chapter 17 - Cryptography, the concept of Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS), often simplified to Forward Secrecy, should also be incorporated into any authentication mechanism design.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.7.24.">Forward Secrecy is a property of secure communication protocols that is intended to prevent a compromised encryption key from being used to decrypt previously encrypted traffic. &#xA0;Clearly a compromised key must be immediately replaced in order to maintain the integrity of communications.&#xA0; This mechanism is described as a &#x201C;rolling secrets&#x201D; technique and is designed to prevent device spoofing and the cloning of mobile clients.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.7.25.">A &#x201C;rolling secret&#x201D; key is located on the client device.&#xA0; The client receives two encrypted packages.&#xA0; The first contains another private key and is decrypted by the current private key held on the client device.&#xA0; The new key is used to decrypt the second package and the new private key replaces the existing private key, which is then discarded.&#xA0; The new key is used to encrypt traffic to the authentication server.&#xA0; With each cycle the client replaces the old key with the new key.</paragraph></block><block title="Cryptography"><paragraph title="16.7.26.">The use of encryption is a fundamental component is the security of a Multi-Factor Authentication mechanism.&#xA0; It is essential that only approved cryptographic protocols and algorithms are used, refer to Chapter 17 &#x2013; Cryptography.</paragraph></block><block title="Risk Analysis"><paragraph title="16.7.27.">The design of Multi-Factor Authentication should start with a risk review in order to identify any existing and new risks from changing environments, user populations and threat landscapes.&#xA0; Some early steps will include:
Review business drivers, existing identity infrastructure, enterprise applications, core platform infrastructure and development plans for each of these;
Ensure any plans for cloud and related services are reviewed and incorporated;
Identify authentication use cases including employees and contractors, consumers, customers, partners, and suppliers.&#xA0; For Digital Government this may also include the General Public for some systems;
Develop baseline requirements;
Undertake a threat analysis for each use case; and
Select control mechanisms to manage identified risks.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.7.28.">This risk analysis will inform and direct the development of an authentication architecture to provide robust but usable security for each use case.&#xA0; Some key questions include:
How will users access the system or application?
At what stage will users be authenticated?
What authentication factors will provide the appropriate level of authentication and security?
Is the level of authentication appropriate to secure and protect the systems, data and other related assets? and
Is there sufficient capacity to service anticipated workloads?
</paragraph></block><block title="Governance and Control"><paragraph title="16.7.29.">Good governance processes assist in identifying potential risks to your systems, data, employees, partners and contractors and reduces the risk of a breach or failure to comply with legislation and regulation.&#xA0; Good governance processes support the fulfilment of fiduciary duties of senior and executive management.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.7.30.">Technology governance must demonstrate effective control, security, effectiveness and clear accountability.&#xA0; Identity Access Management and Authentication are fundamental components in protecting agency systems, data and technology assets and underpinning technology governance structures.&#xA0;</paragraph><paragraph title="16.7.31.">There are also a number of national and international legislative and regulatory requirements and accepted international standards which may influence aspects of governance, particularly in relation to data protection and privacy.&#xA0; While not an exhaustive list, these include:
New Zealand&#x2019;s Privacy Act;
New Zealand&#x2019;s Public Records Act;

System Architecture and Security Controls"><paragraph title="16.7.34.R.01.">Security controls should support security while enabling authorised user access.&#xA0; The system architecture should be sufficiently comprehensive to support this objective.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.7.34.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="6952">The design of an agency&#x2019;s MFA SHOULD include consideration of:
Risk Identification;
Level of security and access control appropriate for each aspect of an agency&#x2019;s information systems (data, devices, equipment, storage, cloud, etc.)
A formal authorisation process for user system access and entitlements;
Logging, monitoring and reporting of activity;
Review of logs for orphaned accounts and inappropriate user access;
Identification of error and anomalies which may indicate inappropriate or malicious activity;
Incident response;
Remediation of errors;
Suspension and/or revocation of access rights where policy violations occur;
Capacity planning.
</paragraph><paragraph title="16.7.34.C.02." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="6953">Where an agency has implemented MFA they SHOULD:
Require MFA for administrative or other high privileged users; and
Implement a secure, multi-factor process to allow users to reset their normal usage user credentials.
</paragraph></block><block title="16.7.35. Integration with Policy"><paragraph title="16.7.35.R.01.">The requirement for an agency information security policy is discussed and described in Chapter 5 &#x2013; Information Security Documentation.&#xA0; Privileged Access Management policy is discussed in Section 16.4 - Privileged Access Management.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.7.35.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="6956">The design of an agency&#x2019;s MFA system SHOULD be integrated with the agency&#x2019;s Information Security Policy and the agency&#x2019;s Privileged Access Management (PAM) Policy.</paragraph></block><block title="16.7.36. User Training"><paragraph title="16.7.36.R.01.">It is important that users understand and have continued awareness of risks and threats to authentication credentials, in order to maintain the integrity of the credentials and to maintain the security of the systems being accessed.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.7.36.R.02.">MFA introduces some complexity and may require the use of specific devices, hardware or applications.&#xA0; Training is essential if additional overhead through increased support is not to be introduced.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.7.36.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Must" CID="6960">When agencies implement MFA they MUST ensure users have an understanding of the risks, and include appropriate usage and safeguards for MFA in the agency&#x2019;s user training and awareness programmes.</paragraph></block></subsection></section></chapter><chapter title="17. Cryptography"><section title="17.1. Cryptographic Fundamentals"><subsection title="Objective"><paragraph title="17.1.1.">Agencies use cryptographic products, algorithms and protocols that are approved by the GCSB and are implemented in accordance with this guidance.</paragraph></subsection><subsection title="Context"><block title="Scope"><paragraph title="17.1.2.">This section covers information on the fundamentals of cryptography including the use of encryption to protect data at rest and in transit. &#xA0;Detailed information on algorithms and protocols approved to protect classified information can be found in Section 17.2 - Approved Cryptographic Algorithms and Section 17.3 - Approved Cryptographic Protocols.</paragraph></block><block title="Purpose of cryptography"><paragraph title="17.1.3.">Cryptography is primarily used to support:
Confidentiality &#x2013; protecting against the risk of information being disclosed to an unauthorised person;
Authentication &#x2013; ensuring a person or entity is who they claim to be;
Integrity &#x2013; ensuring information has not been compromised, either deliberately or accidentally; and
Non-repudiation &#x2013; proving who (or what) performed an action.&#xA0;
</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.4.">Cryptography is an important control for data protection. The encryption selected may change depending on the classification of the data.&#xA0; It is important to note that classification, in itself, provides no protection but is merely a labelling mechanism to indicate the degree of protection and care required in handling that data.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.5.">Cryptography is frequently used in the establishment of secure connectivity (e.g. IPSec VPNs) and in trust frameworks such as those supported by Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.6.">With the increases in speed and computing power and the cost reductions of modern computing, older cryptographic algorithms are increasingly vulnerable. &#xA0;It is vital that recommendations and controls in the NZISM are followed.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.7.">Mitigation of the risks when using older cryptographic algorithms, often takes the form of increased key lengths.&#xA0; Agencies should also note the increasing threat posed by the evolution and development of quantum computing (see 17.1.19 - Quantum Computing and Encryption).</paragraph></block><block title="Encryption"><paragraph title="17.1.8.">Encryption is the process of converting plain (readable) text to an unintelligible form (cipher text).&#xA0; The term encryption is often used synonymously with cryptography.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.9.">The use of approved encryption will generally reduce the likelihood of an unauthorised party gaining access to the information contained within the encrypted data.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.10.">When data is at rest, encryption can be used to reduce the physical protection and handling requirements of media or systems. This does not change the classification of the underlying data system or equipment.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.11.">Care needs to be taken with encryption systems that do not encrypt the entire media content to ensure that either all of the classified data is encrypted or that the media is handled in accordance with the highest classification of the unencrypted data.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.12.">Encryption of data in transit can be used to provide protection for information being communicated over insecure media and hence reduce the security requirements of the communication process.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.13.">It is important to note that when agencies use encryption for data at rest or in transit, they are not reducing the classification of the information. When encryption is used the potential risk of disclosure of the information is reduced.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.14.">As the classification of the information does not change when encrypted, agencies cannot use lowered storage, physical transfer or security requirements as a baseline to further lower requirements with an additional cryptographic product.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.15.">In general terms, the level of assurance of specific encryption protocols and algorithms is defined in terms of Common Criteria, Protection Profiles or, in some cases, approved cryptographic evaluations.&#xA0; It is important to note that evaluations of cryptographic protocols and algorithms are NOT universally conducted when security products are evaluated, relying rather on previous approved evaluations of cryptographic protocols and algorithms.</paragraph></block><block title="Risk Assessments"><paragraph title="17.1.16.">Encryption algorithms apply data transformations that are designed to be difficult to reverse by unauthorised users.&#xA0; Today&#x2019;s software will usually provide several algorithmic options, but may include some older algorithms provided for backward compatibility with older (legacy) systems.&#xA0; In many cases the older algorithms are deprecated, are considered time-expired and are not fit for purpose in modern systems. Deprecated algorithms should not be used.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.17.">In all cases a comprehensive risk assessment should be undertaken before configurations are selected.&#xA0; Some general principles to be considered are:
Cryptographic strength is determined by a combination of the encryption algorithm being used, the encryption protocol and the key length.&#xA0; Longer keys generally provide increased encryption strength over shorter keys when using the same encryption algorithm;
Asymmetric cryptographic algorithms are slower than symmetric cryptographic algorithms at an equivalent cryptographic strength;
Asymmetric cryptographic algorithms are recommended for the exchange of symmetric cryptographic keys when they are needed to be shared across communication channels;
Encrypted data cannot usually be compressed, but compressed data can be encrypted.&#xA0; Data should be compressed before encryption;
Encryption keys have the same requirements for handling and storage as the unencrypted data they are being used to protect;
Any risk assessment should include consideration of key management &#x2013; refer to section 17.9 Key Management.
</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.18.">It is important to note that the NZISM prescribes approved algorithms and protocols and users must select combinations from these lists.</paragraph></block><block title="Quantum Computing and Encryption"><paragraph title="17.1.19.">Developments in quantum computing have highlighted threats to classical cryptography whereby a quantum computing, can undermine all of the widely used public key algorithms used for key establishment and digital signatures.&#xA0; While this may be not an immediate issue, quantum developments are likely to undermine the effectiveness of encryption being used today to protect confidentiality of information.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.20.">A further implication is that historical and archived data protected by encryption may be at risk.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.21.">It is generally accepted that symmetric encryption, with sufficiently long keys, will remain quantum resistant in the short term but that quantum resistant replacements for digital signature and key establishment algorithms will be required in the near future.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.22.">In the longer term, quantum resistant algorithms are expected to be developed, standardised and approved for use.&#xA0; Until such time, however, agencies should be positioning themselves to be ready to migrate to a &#x201C;post-quantum encryption&#x201D; environment.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.23.">As it is now recognised that agencies will need to undertake future migration activities related to post-quantum encryption, it is no longer specifically advised to invest in migration from RSA to ECC-based algorithms if that has not already taken place.&#xA0; Emphasis should instead be placed on ensuring minimum key lengths specified in the NZISM are adhered to.</paragraph></block><block title="Transitioning Cryptographic Algorithms and Protocols"><paragraph title="17.1.24.">It is important to use algorithms that adequately protect sensitive information.&#xA0; It is also important to recognise that all cryptographic algorithms and protocols have a finite life.&#xA0; Challenges are posed by new cryptanalysis techniques and methods, the increasing power of classical computing technology, and the continuing work on the development of quantum computers.&#xA0; In addition, there is an active field of work that continuously seeks to compromise algorithms and protocols currently in&#xA0;use.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.25.">Planning for changes in the use of cryptography because of algorithm breaks, the availability of more powerful computing techniques or new technologies is an important consideration for agencies.&#xA0; Awareness of retirement or deprecation of algorithms and associated protocols is essential.</paragraph></block><block title="RSA "><paragraph title="17.1.26.">RSA was announced in 1976 and is now over 45 years old. Several flaws and attacks have been identified since creation, each of which required specific mitigations, careful implementation and management.&#xA0; Unfortunately there is ample evidence that implementers continue to have difficulties in securely implementing, using and managing RSA.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.27.">To counter identified threats from shorter RSA key lengths, longer key lengths have been specified in the NZISM since 2010.&#xA0; Minimum key lengths have been subsequently increased over time.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.28.">For a number of years there had been several indicators that RSA was likely to be deprecated by the cryptographic community and standards bodies.&#xA0; For example, TLS 1.3 has deprecated the use of RSA for key exchange in favour of elliptic curve cryptography, but RSA is still supported for digital signatures in the current standard.&#xA0; Previous guidance from NIST was also indicative of the impending deprecation of RSA.&#xA0; However, subsequent guidance no longer recommends moving from RSA to elliptic curve if that has not already been done.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.29.">Therefore, while RSA is not fully deprecated in the NZISM, it is approved ONLY for a limited set of uses as described in Section 17.2 &#x2013; Approved Cryptographic Algorithms.</paragraph></block><block title="Product specific cryptographic requirements"><paragraph title="17.1.30.">This section provides requirements for the use of cryptography to protect classified information.&#xA0; Requirements, in addition to those in this Manual, can exist in consumer guides for products once they have completed an approved evaluation.&#xA0; Vendor specifications supplement this manual and where conflict in controls occurs the product specific requirements take precedence.&#xA0; Any policy or compliance conflicts are to be incorporated into the risk assessment.</paragraph></block><block title="Exceptions for using cryptographic products"><paragraph title="17.1.31.">Where Agencies implement a product that uses an Approved Cryptographic Algorithm or Approved Cryptographic Protocol to provide protection of unclassified data at rest or in transit, that product does not require a separate, approved evaluation. &#xA0;Correct implementation of the cryptographic protocol is fundamental to the proper operation of the Approved Cryptographic Algorithm or Approved Cryptographic Protocol and is part of the checking conducted during system certification.</paragraph></block><block title="Federal Information Processing Standard 140"><paragraph title="17.1.32.">FIPS 140 is a United States standard for the evaluation and validation of both hardware and software cryptographic modules.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.33.">FIPS 140 is in its third iteration and is formally referred to as FIPS 140-3.&#xA0; This section refers to the standard as FIPS 140 but this should be considered to encompass FIPS 140-1, FIPS 140-2 and FIPS 140-3.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.34.">FIPS 140 is not a substitute for an approved evaluation of a product with cryptographic functionality. &#xA0;FIPS 140 is concerned solely with the cryptographic functionality of a module and does not consider any other security functionality.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.35.">Cryptographic evaluations of products will normally be conducted by an approved agency. &#xA0;Where a product&#x2019;s cryptographic functionality has been validated under FIPS 140, the GCSB can, at its discretion, and in consultation with the vendor, reduce the scope of a cryptographic evaluation.</paragraph></block><block title="New Zealand National Policy for High Assurance Cryptographic Equipment and Key Management"><paragraph title="17.1.36.">The New Zealand National Standard for High Assurance Cryptographic Equipment (HACE) and related key management is contained in the New Zealand Communications Security Standard No. 301 &#x2013; Safeguarding of Communications Security (COMSEC) Material.&#xA0; This prescribes national doctrine for the safeguarding of COMSEC materials.&#xA0; New Zealand Communications Security Standard No. 301 &#x2013; Safeguarding of Communications Security (COMSEC) Material, replaces New Zealand Communications Security Standard No. 300 &#x2013; Control of COMSEC Material which is now withdrawn. Note NZCSI 301 is a RESTRICTED document.</paragraph></block><block title="Protection of RESTRICTED/SENSITIVE information in transit over public systems"><paragraph title="17.1.37.">The physical requirements for protection of information classified RESTRICTED/SENSITIVE are provided by the classification system and PSR guidance.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.38.">Where such information is generated and held on information systems (any computer device, including laptops, mobile phones, tablets, desktop and networked systems), the requirements of the NZISM apply. Of particular note is the requirement to encrypt RESTRICTED/SENSITIVE data when in transit over public systems, including any Internet connection, public network or any other network NOT directly controlled by the agency.</paragraph></block><block title="Encryption and Key Management"><paragraph title="17.1.39.">Direct agency control is described as the immediate and continuous physical and logical control, responsibility for, protection and operation of agency information systems and data (see 2.2.4).</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.40.">Indirect agency control is described as when information is not under the direct control of the agency, this may be through outsourcing, ICT management or services, third party facilities such as data centre co-locations, or consumption of cloud services (see 2.2.5 &#x2013; 2.2.7).</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.41.">Encryption can be used to protect information not under the direct control of the agency.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.42.">The use of encryption (including data encryption, use of a VPN or any other form of protection using cryptography) requires cryptographic key management and the retention of control of both keys and key management processes.&#xA0;</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.43.">Where agencies make use of VPNs or other forms of network connectivity that protect data in transit, the control and management of the cryptographic key is fundamental to the integrity and confidentiality of the encrypted data.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.44.">If encryption keys are compromised, then any authentication and encryption mechanisms that rely on those keys, no matter how robust or comprehensive, are futile.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.45.">If encryption keys are lost, damaged, or fail then access to data encrypted using those keys will also be lost.&#xA0; If control of encryption keys is lost, then those keys should be considered to be compromised and must be replaced or superceded urgently.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.46.">The selection of the cryptographic protocol and algorithm is described in this chapter and specified in 17.1.55.C.02. It is essential that agencies select and use only approved cryptographic algorithms and protocols (see section 17.2 &#x2013; Approved Cryptographic Protocols) and apply the cryptographic key management requirements of the NZISM (see section 17.9 - Key Management).</paragraph></block><block title="VPN connection Security"><paragraph title="17.1.47.">The types of encryption, protocols, and cryptographic algorithms applied in the establishment and maintenance of a VPN connection are fundamental to the security and integrity of the connection.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.48.">Key aspects of VPN security include:
The encryption algorithm and protocol used;
Cryptographic key length;
The authentication protocol
Key Exchange protocol;
Selection of VPN protocol;
VPN monitoring and a &#x201C;kill switch&#x201D; to deter IP leakage&#xA0;&#xA0; and snooping;
Cryptographic key management.
</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.49.">It is important to understand that a variety of VPN services can use a variety of mechanisms.&#xA0; Agencies should also consider the service provider&#x2019;s use of hash authentication, perfect forward secrecy, and the difference in encryption settings on both the data and control channels.&#xA0; The NZISM specifies the cryptographic protocols and cryptographic algorithms that should be used (see sections 17.2 &#x2013; Approved Cryptographic Algorithms and 17.3 &#x2013; Approved Cryptographic Protocols) and agencies must ensure the VPN connection conforms with these requirements.</paragraph></block></subsection><subsection title="References"><paragraph title="17.1.50.">Further references can be found at:&#xA0;

Information and Systems Protection"><paragraph title="17.1.55.R.01.">When encryption is applied to information being communicated over networks, less assurance is required for the physical protection of the communications infrastructure. In some cases, no physical security can be applied to the communications infrastructure such as public infrastructure, the Internet or non-agency controlled infrastructure. In other cases no direct assurance can be obtained and reliance is placed on third party reviews and reporting. In such cases encryption of information is the only practical mechanism to provide sufficient assurance that the agency information systems are adequately protected.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.55.R.02.">Data duplication for backups or data replication aggregates agency information and will generally increase the impact of an unauthorised party gaining access to, or otherwise compromising, the data.&#xA0; This includes where outsourced services are undertaken.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.55.C.01." classifications="Confidential, Secret, Top Secret" compliances="Must" CID="2089">Agencies MUST use HACE if they wish to communicate or pass information over UNCLASSIFIED, insecure or unprotected networks.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.55.C.02." classifications="Restricted/Sensitive" compliances="Must" CID="2090">Information or systems classified RESTRICTED or SENSITIVE MUST be encrypted with an Approved Cryptographic Algorithm and Protocol if information is transmitted or systems are communicating over insecure or unprotected networks, such as the Internet, public networks or non-agency controlled networks.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.55.C.03." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Must" CID="2091">Agencies MUST encrypt aggregated agency data using an approved algorithm and protocol over insecure or unprotected networks such as the Internet, public infrastructure or non-agency controlled networks when the compromise of the aggregated data would present a significant impact to the agency. &#xA0;</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.55.C.04." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="2092">Agencies SHOULD encrypt agency data using an approved algorithm and protocol if they wish to communicate over insecure or unprotected networks such as the Internet, public networks or non-agency controlled networks.</paragraph></block><block title="17.1.56. IT equipment using Encryption"><paragraph title="17.1.56.R.01.">In general terms, when IT equipment employing encryption functionality is turned on and authenticated all information becomes accessible to the system user. &#xA0;At such a time the IT equipment will need to be handled in accordance with the highest classification of information on the system. &#xA0;Special technology architectures and implementations exist where accessibility continues to be limited when first powered on. &#xA0;Agencies should consult the GCSB for further advice on special architectures and implementations.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.56.R.02.">The classification of the equipment when powered off will depend on the equipment type, cryptographic algorithms and protocols used and whether cryptographic key has been removed. &#xA0;Agencies should consult the GCSB for further advice on treatment of specific software, systems and IT equipment.&#xA0;</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.56.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Must" CID="2096">When IT equipment storing encrypted information is turned on and authenticated, it MUST be treated as per the original classification of the information.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.56.C.02." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Must" CID="2097">Agencies MUST consult the GCSB for further advice on the powered off status and treatment of specific software, systems and IT equipment.</paragraph></block><block title="17.1.57.

Key Refresh and Retirement"><paragraph title="17.1.58.R.01.">All cryptographic keys have a limited useful life after which the key should be replaced or retired. Typically the useful life of the cryptographic key (cryptoperiod) is use, product and situation dependant. Product guidance is the best source of information on establishing cryptoperiods for individual products. A more practical control is the use of data, disk or volume encryption where key changes are more easily managed. Selection of cryptoperiods should be based on a risk assessment.&#xA0;Refer also to section 17.9 &#x2013; Key Management.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.58.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="2103">Agencies SHOULD establish cryptoperiods for all keys and cryptographic implementations in their systems and operations. </paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.58.C.02." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="2104">Agencies SHOULD use risk assessment techniques and guidance to establish cryptoperiods.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.58.C.03." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Must" CID="2105">Agencies using HACE MUST consult the GCSB for key management requirements.</paragraph></block></subsection></section><section title="17.2.

Generation of a unique salt every time a stored credential is created;
Generate salts as cryptographically strong random data;
Use a 32 or 64 bit salt as storage and system constraints permit;
Implement a security schema that is not dependent on hiding, splitting or otherwise obfuscating the salt; and
Do NOT apply salts per user or on a system wide basis.

Mode of operation"><paragraph title="17.8.10.R.01.">The tunnel mode of operation provides full encapsulation of IP packets whilst the transport mode of operation only encapsulates the payload of the IP packet.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.8.10.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="2842">Agencies SHOULD use tunnel mode for IPSec connections.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.8.10.C.02." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="2843">Agencies choosing to use transport mode SHOULD additionally use an IP tunnel for IPSec connections.</paragraph></block><block title="17.8.11. Protocol"><paragraph title="17.8.11.R.01.">In order to provide a secure VPN style connection both authentication and encryption are needed. &#xA0;ESP is the only way of providing encryption yet Authentication Header (AH) and ESP can provide authentication for the entire IP packet and the payload respectively. &#xA0;ESP is generally preferred for authentication though as AH has inherent network address translation limitations.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.8.11.R.02.">If however, maximum security is desired at the expense of network address translation functionality, then ESP can be wrapped inside of AH which will then authenticate the entire IP packet and not just the encrypted payload.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.8.11.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="2847">Agencies SHOULD use the ESP protocol for IPSec connections.</paragraph></block><block title="17.8.12. ISAKMP modes"><paragraph title="17.8.12.R.01.">Using main mode instead of aggressive mode provides greater security since all exchanges are protected.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.8.12.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="2850">Agencies using ISAKMP SHOULD disable aggressive mode for IKE.</paragraph></block><block title="17.8.13. Security association lifetimes"><paragraph title="17.8.13.R.01.">Using a secure association lifetime of four hours or 14400 seconds provides a balance between security and usability.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.8.13.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="2853">Agencies SHOULD use a security association lifetime of four hours or 14400 seconds, or less.</paragraph></block><block title="17.8.14. HMAC algorithms"><paragraph title="17.8.14.R.01.">MD5 and SHA-1 are no longer approved Cryptographic Protocols. &#xA0;The approved algorithms that can be used with HMAC are HMAC-SHA256, HMAC-SHA384 and HMAC-SHA512.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.8.14.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="2856">Agencies SHOULD use HMAC-SHA256, HMAC-SHA384 or HMAC-SHA512 as the HMAC algorithm.</paragraph></block><block title="17.8.15.

Perfect Forward Secrecy"><paragraph title="17.8.16.R.01.">Using Perfect Forward Secrecy reduces the impact of the compromise of a security association.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.8.16.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="2862">Agencies SHOULD use Perfect Forward Secrecy for IPSec connections.</paragraph></block><block title="17.8.17.

Key Management"><subsection title="Objective"><paragraph title="17.9.1.">Cryptographic keying material is protected by key management procedures.</paragraph></subsection><subsection title="Context"><block title="Scope"><paragraph title="17.9.2.">This section covers information relating to the general management of cryptographic system material. &#xA0;Because there is a wide variety of cryptographic systems and technologies available, and there are varied security risks for each, detailed key management guidance is not provided in this manual.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.9.3.">If HGCP or HGCE is being used, agencies are advised to consult the respective NZCSI national standards for the respective equipment.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.9.4.">In a cloud enviroment it is possible to outsource the control of cryptographic key to the cloud service provider, Hold Your Own Keys (HYOK) and Bring Your Own Keys (BYOK). It is important to note that there is little distinction between HYOK and BYOK.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.9.5.">Hold Your Own Keys (HYOK) generally refers to the management of keys by the agency or organisation where keys may be generated by the agency or by a third party such as a National Authority or a Certificate Authority. The agency retains full control of the management of keys.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.9.6.">Bring Your Own Keys (BYOK) also refers to the management of keys by the agency or organisation. In this case keys are provided to the cloud service (or other service) providers for use on outsourced services related to that agency. In such cases, the agency relinquishes some elements of control of the use, storage and protection of the keys.</paragraph></block><block title="Applicability for cryptographic systems"><paragraph title="17.9.7.">In general, the requirements specified in this manual for systems apply equally to cryptographic systems. &#xA0;Where the requirements for cryptographic systems are different, the variations are contained in this section, and take precedence over requirements specified elsewhere in this manual.</paragraph></block><block title="Background"><paragraph title="17.9.8.">Encryption is an unparalleled technology for the protection of information but it relies on the strength of the algorithm, the strength of the key and, most importantly, strong key management.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.9.9.">All encryption has four important characteristics:
The data to be protected;
The algorithm used to encrypt the data;
The protocol used to apply the algorithm; and
The encryption key.
</paragraph><paragraph title="17.9.10.">In almost all cases the algorithm is in the public domain and is not a secret. &#xA0;When an encryption algorithm is publically available, security rests entirely on the secrecy of the encryption key. &#xA0;It is also true that the effectiveness of most encryption systems depends on the secrecy of the encryption key. &#xA0;Approved Cryptographic Algorithms are described in Section 17.2. and Approved Cryptographic Protocols (applying the algorithms) are described in Section 17.3. &#xA0;These sections also specify key strengths to resist attempts to compromise the key through cryptanalysis.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.9.11.">While any algorithm can, theoretically, be broken through cryptanalysis, this may require the use of vast computing power and other resources, making this approach infeasible. &#xA0;If, however, the encryption key is compromised, there is no need to attack the algorithm itself. &#xA0;Attacks on encryption systems will always target the weakest point, the protection of the key. &#xA0;Attempts to compromise keys and key management are more likely and more efficient than attacks on the algorithm itself. &#xA0;This is why strong key management is vital in order to protect the encryption key and keep the key secure and secret. &#xA0;When key management fails, cryptographic security is compromised.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.9.12.">In today&#x2019;s Internet-connected world, almost all Internet security protocols use cryptography for authentication, integrity, confidentiality and non-repudiation. It is vital that good key management is implemented if these security protocols are to be protected, considered reliable and provide required levels of assurance to organisations and users.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.9.13.">In some cases, trusted third-party key management service providers furnish assistance to agencies in the generation, storage, operation, management and retirement (disposal) of keys associated with the agency.</paragraph></block><block title="Key Management"><paragraph title="17.9.14.">For encryption to be used effectively, the encryption keys must be managed with the same care and security as the data encrypted by those keys for the entire lifetime of those keys.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.9.15.">Key Management encompasses the operations and tasks necessary to create, protect and control the use of cryptographic keys. &#xA0;The process from creation to destruction of the encryption key is described as the key management life cycle.</paragraph></block><block title="Key Management Life Cycle"><paragraph title="17.9.16.">The key management lifecycle covers: 
Key generation;
Key registration;
Secure key storage;
Key distribution and installation;
Key use;
Key rotation;
Key backup (operational, backup and archive);
Key replacement and reissue;
Key recovery;
Key revocation;
Key suspension;&#xA0;
Key retirement; and
Key destruction.
</paragraph></block><block title="Open Networks"><paragraph title="17.9.17.">Open networks, by definition, seek to establish arbitrary connections without there necessarily being a pre-existing relationship. &#xA0;Protocols have been developed to manage this requirement through key exchange protocols and through trusted agents, most often a National Authority or Certificate Authority. &#xA0;Again it is important that approved protocols and algorithms, as specified in this document, are used. Refer to sections 17.2 Approved Cryptographic Algorithms and 17.3 Approved Cryptographic Protocols.</paragraph></block><block title="Public Key Infrastructure"><paragraph title="17.9.18.">Public Key Infrastructure was first publically discussed in the early 1970's with some of the first PKI standards from the IETF published in the 1990's. PKI is the system to create, issue, manage and revoke digital certificates and their associated cryptographic keys. PKI has many different applications but typically is used primarily for encrypting and digitally signing data in order to authenticate and protect data in transmission, supporting confidentiality and privacy.&#xA0; It is used extensively in ecommerce, internet banking and secure email as well as being a key element in protecting website traffic.</paragraph></block><block title="Risks"><paragraph title="17.9.19.">There are a number of specific risks related to the management of cryptographic keys. These include:
Keys exposed to unauthorised persons or applications, potentially compromising the keys or data the encryption is protecting;
Data breaches;
Lost or unrecoverable cryptographic keys;
Software based key management, which provides only limited protection;
Fragmented key management as new systems are introduced; and
Poorly documented and understood key management processes and activities increasing the possibility of compromise and potentially increasing compliance costs.
</paragraph></block><block title="Prioritisation"><paragraph title="17.9.20.">Prioritisation helps identify and manage requirements for the use and management of cryptography and key management systems. This will determine the extent and complexity of the key management programme. Important aspects to consider are:
Sensitivity and value of the data. This is summarised by the classification of the data but may not always reflect the values of aggregation, cost of compliance breaches or reputation damage from a breach.
The volume of data and keys.
The variety of key types, data formats, algorithms, protocols and sources.
The speed and frequency of transactions, requirements for data access and availability.
</paragraph></block></subsection><subsection title="References"><paragraph title="17.9.21.">The NZCSI and NZCSS series of policy documents should be consulted for additional information on high assurance cryptography.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.9.22.">Further information on key management practices can be found in the following references:

With its inclusion in the initial release of the WPA2 standard, it enjoys wide support in wireless access points and in numerous operating systems such as Microsoft Windows, Linux and Apple OS X. EAP-TLS uses a public key infrastructure (PKI) to secure communications between devices and a Remote Access Dial In User Service (RADIUS) server through the use of X.509 certificates. While EAP-TLS provides strong mutual authentication, it requires an agency to have established a PKI. This involves either deploying their own certificate authority and issuing certificates, or purchasing certificates from a commercial certificate authority, for every device that accesses the wireless network. This can introduce additional costs and management overheads but the risk and security management advantages are significant.The EAP-TTLS/MSCHAPv2, or simply EAP-TTLS, method used with WPA2-Enterprise is generally supported through the use of third party software. It has support in multiple operating systems including Microsoft Windows 7, 8, 10 and Server 2012 but does not have native support in earlier versions of Microsoft Windows. EAP-TTLS is different to EAP-TLS in that devices do not authenticate to the server when the initial TLS tunnel is created. Only the server authenticates to devices. Once the TLS tunnel has been created, mutual authentication occurs through the use of another EAP method.An advantage of EAP-TTLS over PEAP is that a username is never transmitted in the clear outside of the TLS tunnel. Another advantage of EAP-TTLS is that it provides support for many legacy EAP methods, while PEAP is generally limited to the use of EAP-MSCHAPv2.PEAPv0/EAP-MSCHAPv2, or simply PEAP, is the second most widely supported EAP method after EAP-TLS. It enjoys wide support in wireless access points and in numerous operating systems such as Microsoft Windows, Linux and Apple OS X. PEAP operates in a very similar way to EAP-TTLS by creating a TLS tunnel which is used to protect another EAP method. PEAP differs from EAP-TTLS in that when the EAP-MSCHAPv2 method is used within the TLS tunnel, only the password portion is protected and not the username. This may allow an intruder to capture the username and replay it with a bogus password in order to lockout the user&#x2019;s account, causing a denial of service for that user. While EAP-MSCHAPv2 within PEAP is the most common implementation, Microsoft Windows supports the use of EAP-TLS within PEAP, known as PEAP-EAP-TLS. This approach is very similar in operation to traditional EAP-TLS yet provides increased protection, as parts of the certificate that are not encrypted with EAP-TLS are encrypted with PEAP-EAP-TLS. The downside to PEAP-EAP-TLS is its support is limited to Microsoft products.</paragraph><paragraph title="18.2.9.R.03.">Ultimately, an agency&#x2019;s choice in authentication method will often be based on the size of their wireless deployment, their security requirements and any existing authentication infrastructure. &#xA0;If an agency is primarily motivated by security they can implement either PEAP-EAP-TLS or EAP-TLS. &#xA0;If they are primarily motivated by flexibility and legacy support they can implement EAP-TTLS. &#xA0;If they are primarily motivated by simplicity they can implement PEAP with EAP-MSCHAPv2.</paragraph><paragraph title="18.2.9.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Must" CID="3319">WPA2-Enterprise with EAP-TLS, WPA2-Enterprise with PEAP-EAP-TLS, WPA2-Enterprise with EAP-TTLS or WPA2-Enterprise with PEAP MUST be used on wireless networks to perform mutual authentication.</paragraph></block><block title="18.2.10.

Issuing certificates for authentication"><paragraph title="18.2.11.R.01.">Certificates for authenticating to wireless networks can be issued to either or both devices and users. &#xA0;For assurance, certificates must be generated using a certificate authority product or hardware security module (HSM) that has completed an appropriate product evaluation.</paragraph><paragraph title="18.2.11.R.02.">When issuing certificates to devices accessing wireless networks, agencies need to be aware of the risk that these certificates could be stolen by malicious software. &#xA0;Once compromised, the certificate could be used on another device to gain unauthorised access to the wireless network. &#xA0;Agencies also need to be aware that in only issuing a certificate to a device, any actions taken by a user will only be attributable to the device and not a specific user.</paragraph><paragraph title="18.2.11.R.03.">When issuing certificates to users accessing wireless networks, they can either be in the form of a certificate that is stored on a device or a certificate that is stored within a smart card. Issuing certificates on smart cards provides increased security, but usually at a higher cost. Security is improved because a user is more likely to notice a missing smart card and alert their local security team, who is then able to revoke the credentials on the RADIUS server. This can minimise the time an intruder has access to a wireless network.</paragraph><paragraph title="18.2.11.R.04.">In addition, to reduce the likelihood of a stolen smart card from being used to gain unauthorised access to a wireless network, two-factor authentication can be implemented through the use of Personal Identification Numbers (PINs) on smart cards. &#xA0;This is essential when a smart card grants a user any form of administrative access on a wireless network or attached network resource.</paragraph><paragraph title="18.2.11.R.05.">For the highest level of security, unique certificates should be issued for both devices and users. In addition, the certificates for a device and user must not be stored on the same device. Finally, certificates for users accessing wireless networks should be issued on smart cards with access PINs and not stored with a device when not in use.</paragraph><paragraph title="18.2.11.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Must" CID="3343">Agencies MUST generate certificates using a certificate authority product or hardware security module that has completed an appropriate product evaluation.</paragraph><paragraph title="18.2.11.C.02." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Must Not" CID="3346">The certificates for both a device and user accessing a wireless network MUST NOT be stored on the same device.</paragraph><paragraph title="18.2.11.C.03." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="3348">Agencies SHOULD use unique certificates for both devices and users accessing a wireless network.</paragraph><paragraph title="18.2.11.C.04." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="3350">Certificates for users accessing wireless networks SHOULD be issued on smart cards with access PINs and not stored with a device when not in use.</paragraph><paragraph title="18.2.11.C.05." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="3351">Certificates stored on devices accessing wireless networks SHOULD be protected by implementing full disk encryption on the devices.</paragraph></block><block title="18.2.12. Using commercial certification authorities for certificate generation"><paragraph title="18.2.12.R.01.">A security risk exists with EAP-TTLS and PEAP when a commercial certificate authority&#x2019;s certificates are automatically trusted by devices using vendor trusted certificate stores. This trust can be exploited by obtaining certificates from a commercial certificate authority under false pretences, as devices can be tricked into trusting their signed certificate. This will allow the capture of authentication credentials presented by devices, which in the case of EAP-MSCHAPv2 can be cracked using a brute force attack granting not only network access but most likely Active Directory credentials as well.To reduce this risk, devices can be configured to:
validate the server certificate;
disable any trust for certificates generated by commercial certificate authorities that are not trusted;
disable the ability to prompt users to authorise net servers or commercial certificate authorities; and
set devices to enable identity privacy to prevent usernames being sent prior to being authenticated by the RADIUS server.

Caching 802.1X authentication outcomes"><paragraph title="18.2.13.R.01.">When 802.1X authentication is used, a shared secret key known as the Pairwise Master Key (PMK) is generated. &#xA0;Upon successful authentication of a device, the PMK can be cached to assist with fast roaming between wireless access points. &#xA0;When a device roams away from a wireless access point that it has authenticated to, it will not need to perform a full re-authentication should it roam back while the cached PMK remains valid. &#xA0;To further assist with roaming, wireless access points can be configured to pre-authenticate a device to other neighbouring wireless access points that the device might roam to. &#xA0;Although requiring full authentication for a device each time it roams between wireless access points is ideal, agencies can chose to use PMK caching and pre-authentication if they have a business requirement for fast roaming. &#xA0;If PMK caching is used, the PMK caching period should not be set to greater than 1440 minutes (24 hours).</paragraph><paragraph title="18.2.13.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should Not" CID="3358">The PMK caching period SHOULD NOT be set to greater than 1440 minutes (24 hours).</paragraph></block><block title="18.2.14. Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) authentication"><paragraph title="18.2.14.R.01.">The RADIUS authentication process that occurs between wireless access points and the RADIUS server is distinct and a separate to the 802.1X authentication process. &#xA0;During the initial configuration of wireless networks using 802.1X authentication, a shared secret is entered into either the wireless access points or the RADIUS server. &#xA0;If configured on the wireless access points, the shared secret is sent to the RADIUS server via the RADIUS protocol, and vice versa if configured on the RADIUS server. &#xA0;This shared secret is used for both RADIUS authentication and confidentiality of RADIUS traffic.</paragraph><paragraph title="18.2.14.R.02.">An intruder that is able to gain access to the RADIUS traffic sent between wireless access points and the RADIUS server may be able to perform a brute force or an off-line dictionary attack to recover the shared secret. &#xA0;This in turn allows the intruder to decrypt all communications between wireless access points and the RADIUS server. &#xA0;To mitigate this security risk, communications between wireless access points and a RADIUS server must be encapsulated with an additional layer of encryption using an appropriate encryption product (See Chapter 17 &#x2013; Cryptography).</paragraph><paragraph title="18.2.14.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Must" CID="3362">Communications between wireless access points and a RADIUS server MUST be encapsulated with an additional layer of encryption using an approved encryption product (See Chapter 17 &#x2013; Cryptography).</paragraph></block><block title="18.2.15.

SSID Broadcasting"><paragraph title="18.2.25.R.01.">A common method to lower the profile of wireless networks is disabling SSID broadcasting. &#xA0;While this ensures that the existence of wireless networks are not broadcast overtly using beacon frames, the SSID is still broadcast in probe requests, probe responses, association requests and re-association requests for the network. &#xA0;Malicious actors can determine the SSID of wireless networks by capturing these requests and responses. &#xA0;By disabling SSID broadcasting agencies will make it more difficult for legitimate users to connect to wireless networks as legacy operating systems have only limited support for hidden SSIDs. &#xA0;Disabling SSID broadcasting infringes the design of the 802.11x standards.</paragraph><paragraph title="18.2.25.R.02.">A further risk exists where an intruder can configure a wireless access point to broadcast the same SSID as the hidden SSID used by a legitimate wireless network. In this scenario devices will automatically connect to the wireless access point that is broadcasting the SSID they are configured to use before probing for a wireless access point that accepts the hidden SSID. Once the device is connected to the intruder&#x2019;s wireless access point the intruder can steal authentication credentials from the device to perform a man-in-the-middle attack to capture legitimate wireless network traffic or to later reuse to gain access to the legitimate wireless network.</paragraph><paragraph title="18.2.25.R.03.">Disabling SSID broadcasting is not considered to be an effective control and may introduce additional risks.</paragraph><paragraph title="18.2.25.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should Not" CID="3514">Agencies SHOULD NOT disable SSID broadcasting on wireless networks.</paragraph></block><block title="18.2.26.

VTC and IPT Device setup"><paragraph title="18.3.12.R.01.">VTC equipment and VoIP phones need to be hardened and separated or segregated from the data network to ensure they will not provide an easy entry point to the network for an attacker.</paragraph><paragraph title="18.3.12.R.02.">USB ports on these devices can be used to circumvent USB workstation policy and upload malicious software for unauthorised call recording/spoofing and entry into the data network. &#xA0;Unauthorised or unauthenticated devices should be blocked by default to reduce the risk of a compromise or denial of service.</paragraph><paragraph title="18.3.12.C.01." classifications="Confidential, Secret, Top Secret" compliances="Must" CID="3740">Agencies MUST:
configure VTC and VoIP devices to authenticate themselves to the call controller upon registration;

functionality for voice mail and directory services; and
use a separate network segment.
</paragraph><paragraph title="18.3.15.C.02." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="3758">Agencies SHOULD, where available, use traditional analogue phones in a lobby and shared areas.</paragraph></block><block title="18.3.16. Usage of softphones, webcams and similar sound and video devices"><paragraph title="18.3.16.R.01.">Software and applications for softphones and webcams can introduce additional attack vectors into the network as they are exposed to threats from the data network via the workstation and can subsequently be used to gain access to the network.</paragraph><paragraph title="18.3.16.R.02.">Softphones and webcams typically require workstation to workstation communication, normally using a number of randomly assigned ports to facilitate RTP data exchange. &#xA0;This presents a security risk as workstations generally should be separated using host-based firewalls that deny all connections between workstations to make malicious code propagation inside the network difficult.</paragraph><paragraph title="18.3.16.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="3766">Agencies using softphones or webcams SHOULD have separate dedicated network interface cards on the host for VTC or IPT network access to facilitate VLAN separation.</paragraph><paragraph title="18.3.16.C.02." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="3768">Agencies using softphones or webcams SHOULD install a host-based firewall on workstations utilising softphones or webcams that allows traffic only to and from a minimum number of ports.</paragraph><paragraph title="18.3.16.C.03." classifications="Confidential, Secret, Top Secret" compliances="Should Not" CID="3770">Agencies SHOULD NOT use softphones or webcams.</paragraph></block><block title="18.3.17. Workstations using USB softphones, webcams and similar sound and video devices"><paragraph title="18.3.17.R.01.">Adding softphones and webcams to a whitelist of allowed USB devices on a workstation will assist with restricting access to only authorised devices, and allowing the SOE to maintain defences against removable media storage and other unauthorised USB devices.</paragraph><paragraph title="18.3.17.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="3777">Agencies SHOULD use access control software to control USB ports on workstations using softphones and webcams by utilising the specific vendor and product identifier of the authorised device.</paragraph></block><block title="18.3.18. Developing a denial of service response plan"><paragraph title="18.3.18.R.01.">Communications are considered critical for any business and are therefore especially vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS). &#xA0;The guidance provided will assist in protecting against VTC or IPT DoS attacks, signalling floods, established call teardown and RTP data floods. &#xA0;These elements should be included in the agency&#x2019;s wider response plan (See Section 6.4 &#x2013; Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery).</paragraph><paragraph title="18.3.18.R.02.">Simple DoS attacks and incidents are often the result of bandwidth exhaustion. &#xA0;Agencies should also consider other forms of DoS including Distributed Denial of Service attacks (DdoS), DNS and latency incidents.</paragraph><paragraph title="18.3.18.R.03.">System resilience can be improved by architecting a structured approach and providing layered defence such as network and application protection as separate layers.</paragraph><paragraph title="18.3.18.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="3782">Agencies SHOULD develop a Denial of Service response plan including:
how to identify the precursors and other signs of DoS;
how to diagnose the incident or attack type and attack method;
how to diagnose the source of the DoS;
what actions can be taken to clear the DoS;&#xA0;
how communications can be maintained during a DoS; and
report the incident.
</paragraph></block><block title="18.3.19. Content of a Denial of Service (DoS) response plan"><paragraph title="18.3.19.R.01.">An VTC or IPT DoS response plan will need to address the following:
how to identify the source of the DoS, either internal or external (location and content of logs);
how to diagnose the incident or attack type and attack method;
how to minimise the effect on VTC or IPT, of a DoS of the data network (e.g. Internet or internal DoS), including separate links to other office locations for VTC and IPT and/or quality of service prioritisation;
strategies that can mitigate the DOS (banning certain devices/Ips at the call controller and firewalls, implementing quality of service, changing VoIP authentication, changing dial-in authentication; and
alternative communication options (such as designated devices or personal mobile phones) that have been identified for use in case of an emergency.
</paragraph><paragraph title="18.3.19.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="3785">A Denial of Service response plan SHOULD include monitoring and use of:
router and switch logging and flow data;
packet captures;
proxy and call manager logs and access control lists;
VTC and IPT aware firewalls and voice gateways;
network redundancy;
load balancing;&#xA0;
PSTN failover; and
alternative communication paths.
</paragraph></block></subsection></section><section title="18.4. Intrusion Detection and Prevention"><subsection title="Objective"><paragraph title="18.4.1.">An intrusion detection and prevention strategy is implemented for systems in order to respond promptly to incidents and preserve availability, confidentiality and integrity of systems.</paragraph></subsection><subsection title="Context"><block title="Scope"><paragraph title="18.4.2.">This section covers information relating to detection and prevention of malicious code propagating through networks as well as the detection and prevention of unusual or malicious activities.</paragraph></block><block title="Methods of infections or delivery"><paragraph title="18.4.3.">Malicious code can spread through a system from a number of sources including:
files containing macro viruses or worms;
email attachments and Web downloads with malicious active content;
executable code in the form of applications;
security weaknesses in a system or network;
security weaknesses in an application;&#xA0;
contact with an infected system or media; or
deliberate introduction of malicious code.
</paragraph><paragraph title="18.4.4.">The speed at which malicious code can spread through a system presents significant challenges and an important part of any defensive strategy is to contain the attack and limit damage.</paragraph></block></subsection><subsection title="References"><paragraph title="18.4.5.">

</paragraph></block><block title="19.2.17. Implementing Cross Domain Solutions"><paragraph title="19.2.17.R.01.">Connecting multiple sets of gateways and Cross Domain Solutions (CDS) increases the threat surface and, consequently, the likelihood and impact of a network compromise.&#xA0; When a gateway and a CDS share a common network, the higher security domain (such as a classified agency network) can be exposed to malicious activity, exploitation or denial of service from the lower security domain (such as the Internet).</paragraph><paragraph title="19.2.17.R.02.">To manage this risk, CDS should implement products that have completed a high assurance evaluation, see Chapter 12 &#x2013; Product Security.&#xA0; The AISEP Evaluated Product List (EPL) includes products that have been evaluated in the high assurance scheme but is not an exhaustive list.Where CDS are not listed on the AISEP EPL, the GCSB can provide guidance on product selection and implementation on request.</paragraph><paragraph title="19.2.17.C.01." classifications="Confidential, Secret" compliances="Must" CID="3926">When designing and deploying a CDS, agencies MUST consult with the GCSB and comply with all directions provided.</paragraph><paragraph title="19.2.17.C.02." classifications="Confidential, Secret, Top Secret" compliances="Must" CID="3927">Agencies connecting a typical gateway and a CDS to a common network MUST consult the GCSB on the impact to the security of the CDS and comply with all directions provided.</paragraph></block><block title="19.2.18. Separation of data flows"><paragraph title="19.2.18.R.01.">Gateways connecting highly classified systems to lower classified, or Internet connected systems need to incorporate physically separate paths to provide stronger control of information flows.&#xA0; Typically this is achieved through separate pathing and the use of diodes. Such gateways are generally restricted to process and communicate only highly-structured formal messaging traffic.</paragraph><paragraph title="19.2.18.C.01." classifications="Confidential, Secret, Top Secret" compliances="Must" CID="3929">Agencies MUST ensure that all bi-directional gateways between TOP SECRET and SECRET networks, SECRET and less classified networks, and CONFIDENTIAL and less classified networks, have separate upward and downward paths which use a diode and physically separate infrastructure for each path.</paragraph></block><block title="19.2.19. Trusted sources"><paragraph title="19.2.19.R.01.">Trusted sources are designated personnel who have the delegated authority to assess and approve the transfer or release of data or documents.&#xA0; Trusted sources may include security personnel within the agency such the CISO and the ITSM.</paragraph><paragraph title="19.2.19.C.01." classifications="Confidential, Secret, Top Secret" compliances="Must" CID="3932">Trusted sources MUST be:
a strictly limited list derived from business requirements and the result of a security risk assessment;
where necessary an appropriate security clearance is held; and
approved by the Accreditation Authority.
</paragraph><paragraph title="19.2.19.C.02." classifications="Confidential, Secret, Top Secret" compliances="Must" CID="3933">Trusted sources MUST authorise all data to be exported from a security domain.</paragraph></block><block title="19.2.20. Operation of the Cross Domain Solution"><paragraph title="19.2.20.R.01.">The highly sensitive nature of the data within cross domain solutions requires additional audit and logging for control, management, record and forensic purposes.&#xA0; This is in addition to the audit and logging requirements in Section 16.5 &#x2013; Event Logging and Auditing.</paragraph><paragraph title="19.2.20.C.01." classifications="Confidential, Secret, Top Secret" compliances="Must" CID="3936">All data exported from a security domain MUST be logged.</paragraph></block></subsection></section><section title="19.3.

Design a highly operationally optimised network requiring minimal maintenance;
Provide resources, including SBCs, softswitches and media gateways that are shared between a number of customers (such as multi-tenanted data centres);
The standard model may not accommodate all unique agency or NZ Government requirements which will then require special consideration.

</paragraph></block><block title="Definitions"><paragraph title="19.5.5.">A Session Border Controller (SBC) is a device (physical or virtual) used in IP networks to control and manage the signalling and media streams of real-time UC and VoIP connections.&#xA0; See also Section 18.3 &#x2013; Video &amp; Telephony Conferencing and Internet Protocol Telephony.&#xA0; It includes establishing, controlling, and terminating calls, interactive media communications or other VoIP connections.&#xA0; SBCs enable VoIP traffic to navigate gateways and firewalls and ensure interoperability between different SIP implementations.&#xA0; Careful selection of SBCs will provide such functionality as prevention of toll fraud, resistance to denial of service attacks and resistance to eavesdropping.</paragraph><paragraph title="19.5.6.">Unified Communications (UC) is a term describing the integration of real-time and near real time communication and interaction services in an organisation or agency.&#xA0; UC may integrate several communication systems including unified messaging, collaboration, and interaction systems; real-time and near real-time communications; and transactional applications.</paragraph><paragraph title="19.5.7.">UC may, for example, include services such as instant messaging (chat), presence information, voice, mobility, audio, web &amp; video conferencing, data sharing (such as interactive whiteboards), voicemail, e-mail, SMS and fax.&#xA0; UC is not necessarily a single product, but more usually a set of products designed to provide a unified user-interface and user-experience across multiple devices and media-types.</paragraph></block></subsection><subsection title="Purpose"><paragraph title="19.5.8.">Traditional demarcation points, such as media gateways, are no longer natural boundaries.&#xA0; Older firewall technology impacts the performance of communications systems, including VoIP and UC.&#xA0; SBCs were introduced to improve performance and provide interoperability with real-time and near real-time communications.&#xA0; They provide a new natural demarcation point.</paragraph><paragraph title="19.5.9.">SBCs can provide a demarcation or normalisation point within the agency&#x2019;s network, allow enforcement of agency specific security policies and provide a greater degree of accountability than the usual contract with service providers.</paragraph></subsection><subsection title="Risks and Threats"><block title="Confidentiality"><paragraph title="19.5.11.">There is a high likelihood of eavesdropping in VoIP systems. Traditional telephone systems require physical access to tap a line or compromise a PABX or switch.&#xA0; In VoIP networks, virtual LAN environments can be exploited remotely to identify weaknesses within and between virtual LANs and gain access to valuable information.&#xA0; Sniffing is another form of eavesdropping that involves capturing unencrypted voice traffic with malware or a specific VoIP sniffer tool.&#xA0; In common with other Internet connected systems, man-in-the-middle exploits are also used to eavesdrop on both data and VoIP networks.</paragraph></block><block title="Integrity"><paragraph title="19.5.12.">Exploits such as caller ID spoofing are relatively easy to execute and can be extremely costly to businesses.&#xA0; Information from a stolen credit card or acquisition of other sensitive data, can compromise an employee&#x2019;s caller ID, and have funds transferred while posing as the employee.&#xA0; Cyber criminals can also change an employee&#x2019;s registration information in order to eavesdrop on or intercept all incoming calls for that individual.</paragraph><paragraph title="19.5.13.">Integrity compromise may include modification or insertion into UC.&#xA0; As many UC elements, such as voicemail or email, may encompass electronic records as defined in legislation it is vital that these elements are preserved unaltered.</paragraph></block><block title="Availability"><paragraph title="19.5.14.">Because VoIP and UC places high levels of demand on any network, managing Quality of Service (QoS), latency, jitter, packet loss and other service impediments are important aspects of availability.&#xA0; In the event of major faults or outages, diversity and fault tolerance is vital for all key sites.&#xA0; To enable failover, for example, where calls leave the customer network, call diversity and call failover are essential configuration elements.</paragraph></block><block title="Denial of Service"><paragraph title="19.5.15.">Denial of Service (DoS) attacks abuse signalling protocols to deny availability of VoIP data and degrade performance.&#xA0; If the telecommunications network is compromised, it is possible to also traverse systems to attack or infect the agency&#x2019;s data networks and other systems.</paragraph></block></subsection><subsection title="Common VoIP and UC Security Risks and Threats"><paragraph title="19.5.16.">Common VoIP and UC security risks and threats.

confirm the file type by examination of the contents of the file;
confirm the absence of malicious content;
confirm the absence of inappropriate content;
confirm the classification of the content; and
handle compressed files appropriately.

Technique


Purpose




Antivirus scan


Scans the data for viruses and other malicious code.




Data format check


Inspects data to ensure that it conforms to expected/permitted format(s).




Data range check


Checks the data within each field to ensure that it falls within the expected/permitted range.




Data type check


Inspects each file header to determine the file type.




File extension check


Checks file extensions to ensure that they are permitted.




Keyword search


Searches data for keywords or &#x2018;dirty words&#x2019; that could indicate the presence of classified or inappropriate material.




Metadata check


Inspects files for metadata that should be removed prior to release.




Protective marking check


Validates the protective marking of the data to ensure that it complies with the permitted classifications and endorsements.




Manual inspection


The manual inspection of data for suspicious content that an automated system could miss, which is particularly important for the transfer of image files, multi-media or content-rich files.



</paragraph><paragraph title="20.3.6.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Must" CID="4329">Agencies MUST block, quarantine or drop any data identified by a data filter as suspicious until reviewed and approved for transfer by a trusted source other than the originator.</paragraph></block><block title="20.3.7. Content validation"><paragraph title="20.3.7.R.01.">Content validation aims to ensure that the content received conforms to a defined, approved standard. Content validation can be an effective means of identifying malformed content, allowing agencies to block potentially malicious content. Content validation operates on a whitelisting principle, blocking all content except for that which is explicitly permitted. Examples of content validation include:
ensuring numeric fields only contain numeric numbers;
other fields operate with defined character sets;
ensuring content falls within acceptable length boundaries;
ensuring XML documents are compared to a strictly defined XML schema.
</paragraph><paragraph title="20.3.7.C.01." classifications="Confidential, Secret, Top Secret" compliances="Must" CID="4332">Agencies MUST perform validation on all data passing through a content filter, blocking content which fails the validation.</paragraph><paragraph title="20.3.7.C.02." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="4333">Agencies SHOULD perform validation on all data passing through a content filter, blocking content which fails the validation.</paragraph></block><block title="20.3.8. Content conversion and transformation"><paragraph title="20.3.8.R.01.">Content conversion, file conversion or file transformation can be an effective method to render potentially malicious content harmless by separating the presentation format from the data. By converting a file to another format, the exploit, active content and/or payload can often be removed or disrupted enough to be ineffective.Examples of file conversion and content transformation to mitigate the threat of content exploitation include:
converting a Microsoft Word document to a PDF file;
converting a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation to a series of JPEG images;
converting a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet to a Comma Separated Values (CSV) file; or
converting a PDF document to a plain text file.
Some file types, such as XML, will not benefit from conversion. The conversion process should also be applied to any attachments or files contained within other files, for example, archive files or encoded files embedded in XML.</paragraph><paragraph title="20.3.8.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="4336">Agencies SHOULD perform content conversion, file conversion or both for all ingress or egress data transiting a security domain boundary.</paragraph></block><block title="20.3.9. Content sanitisation"><paragraph title="20.3.9.R.01.">Sanitisation is the process of attempting to make potentially malicious content safe to use by removing or altering active content while leaving the original content as intact as possible. Sanitisation is not as secure a method of content filtering as conversion, though many techniques may be combined. Extraneous application and protocol data, including metadata, should also be inspected and filtered where possible. Examples of sanitisation to mitigate the threat of content exploitation include:
removal of document properties information in Microsoft Office documents;
removal or renaming of Javascript sections from PDF files;
removal of metadata such as EXIF information from within JPEG files.
</paragraph><paragraph title="20.3.9.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="4339">Agencies SHOULD perform content and file sanitisation on suitable file types if content conversion or file conversion is not appropriate for data transiting a security domain boundary.</paragraph></block><block title="20.3.10. Antivirus scans"><paragraph title="20.3.10.R.01.">Antivirus scanning is used to prevent, detect and remove malicious software that includes computer viruses, worms, Trojans, spyware and adware.</paragraph><paragraph title="20.3.10.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="4348">Agencies SHOULD perform antivirus scans on all content using up-to-date engines and signatures, using multiple different scanning engines.</paragraph></block><block title="20.3.11. Archive and container files"><paragraph title="20.3.11.R.01.">Archive and container files can be used to bypass content filtering processes if the content filter does not handle the file type and embedded content correctly. &#xA0;The content filtering process should recognise archived and container files, ensuring the embedded files they contain are subject to the same content filtering measures as un-archived files.</paragraph><paragraph title="20.3.11.R.02.">Archive files can be constructed in a manner which can pose a denial-of-service risk due to processor, memory or disk space exhaustion. &#xA0;To limit the risk of such an attack, content filters can specify resource constraints/quotas while extracting these files. &#xA0;If these constraints are exceeded the inspection is terminated, the content blocked and a security administrator alerted.</paragraph><paragraph title="20.3.11.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="4401">Agencies SHOULD extract the contents from archive and container files and subject the extracted files to content filter tests.</paragraph><paragraph title="20.3.11.C.02." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="4402">Agencies SHOULD perform controlled inspection of archive and container files to ensure that content filter performance and availability is not adversely affected.</paragraph><paragraph title="20.3.11.C.03." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="4403">Agencies SHOULD block files that cannot be inspected and generate an alert or notification.</paragraph></block><block title="20.3.12. Whitelisting permitted content"><paragraph title="20.3.12.R.01.">Creating and enforcing a whitelist of allowed content/files is a strong content filtering method. &#xA0;Allowing content that satisfies a business requirement only can reduce the attack surface of the system. &#xA0;As a simple example, an email content filter might allow only Microsoft Office documents and PDF files.</paragraph><paragraph title="20.3.12.C.01." classifications="Confidential, Secret, Top Secret" compliances="Must" CID="4406">Agencies MUST create and enforce a whitelist of permitted content types based on business requirements and the results of a security risk assessment.</paragraph><paragraph title="20.3.12.C.02." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="4407">Agencies SHOULD create and enforce a whitelist of permitted content types based on business requirements and the results of a security risk assessment.</paragraph></block><block title="20.3.13. Data integrity"><paragraph title="20.3.13.R.01.">Ensuring the authenticity and integrity of content reaching a security domain is a key component in ensuring its trustworthiness. It is also essential that content that has been authorised for release from a security domain is not modified or contains other data not authorised for release, for example by the addition or substitution of sensitive information.</paragraph><paragraph title="20.3.13.R.02.">If content passing through a filter contains a form of integrity protection, such as a digital signature, the content filter should verify the content&#x2019;s integrity before allowing it through. If the content fails these integrity checks it may have been spoofed or tampered with and should be dropped or quarantined for further inspection.Examples of data integrity checks include:
an email server or content filter verifying an email protected by DKIM;
a web service verifying the XML digital signature contained within a SOAP request;
validating a file against a separately supplied hash;
checking that data to be exported from the security domain has been digitally signed by the release authority.
</paragraph><paragraph title="20.3.13.C.01." classifications="Confidential, Secret, Top Secret" compliances="Must" CID="4411">If data is signed, agencies MUST ensure that the signature is validated before the data is exported.</paragraph><paragraph title="20.3.13.C.02." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="4412">Agencies SHOULD verify the integrity of content where applicable, and block the content if verification fails.</paragraph></block><block title="20.3.14. Encrypted data"><paragraph title="20.3.14.R.01.">Encryption can be used to bypass content filtering if encrypted content cannot be subject to the same checks performed on unencrypted content. Agencies will need to consider the need to decrypt content, depending on:
the security domain they are communicating with;
whether the need-to-know principle is to be enforced;
end-to-end encryption requirements; or
any privacy and policy requirements.
</paragraph><paragraph title="20.3.14.R.02.">Choosing not to decrypt content poses a risk of encrypted malicious software communications and data moving between security domains. &#xA0;Additionally, encryption could mask the movement of information at a higher classification being allowed to pass to a security domain of lower classification, which could result in a data spill.</paragraph><paragraph title="20.3.14.R.03.">Some systems allow encrypted content through external/boundary/perimeter controls to be decrypted at a later stage, in which case the content should be subject to all applicable content filtering controls after it has been decrypted.</paragraph><paragraph title="20.3.14.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="4417">Agencies SHOULD decrypt and inspect all encrypted content, traffic and data to allow content filtering.</paragraph></block><block title="20.3.15.

Enterprise systems security"><section title="22.1. Cloud Computing"><subsection title="Objective"><paragraph title="22.1.1.">Cloud systems risks are identified and managed and that Official Information and agency information systems are protected in accordance with Cabinet Directives, the PSR, the New Zealand Government Security Classification System, the NZISM and with other government security&#xA0;requirements and guidance.</paragraph></subsection><subsection title="Context"><block title="Terminology"><paragraph title="22.1.2.">Terminology and definitions of cloud models and services used in this section are consistent with NIST Special Publication 800-145, The NIST Definition of Cloud Computing, dated September 2011 (see table of References below).</paragraph><paragraph title="22.1.3.">A fundamental construct in the management of risk in cloud environment is that of Trust Zones and Trust Boundaries. &#xA0;A Trust Zone is a zoning construct based on levels of trust, classification, information asset value and essential information security. &#xA0;A Trust Boundary is the interface between two or more Trust Zones. &#xA0;Trust Zones use the principles of separation and segregation to manage sensitive information assets and ensure security policies are consistently applied to all assets in a particular trust Zone. &#xA0;Refer also to Section 22.2 &#x2013; Virtualisation.</paragraph></block><block title="Separation and Segregation"><paragraph title="22.1.4.">Separation and Segregation is determined by system function and the sensitivity of the data the system stores, processes and transmits. &#xA0;One common example is placing systems that require a connection to the Internet into a demilitarized zone (DMZ) that is separated and segregated (isolated) from more sensitive systems.</paragraph><paragraph title="22.1.5.">Separation and Segregation limits the ability of an intruder to exploit a vulnerability with the intent of elevating privileges to gain access to more sensitive systems on the internal network. &#xA0;VLANs may be used to further separate systems by controlling access and providing segregation thus giving additional protection.</paragraph></block><block title="Mandates and Requirements"><paragraph title="22.1.6.">In August 2013, the Government introduced their approach to cloud computing, establishing a &#x2018;cloud first&#x2019; policy and an All-of-Government direction to cloud services development and deployment. This is enabled by the Cabinet Minute [CAB Min (13) 37/6B].</paragraph><paragraph title="22.1.7.">Under the &#x2018;cloud first&#x2019; policy state service agencies are expected to adopt approved cloud services either when faced with new procurements, or an upcoming contract extension decision.</paragraph><paragraph title="22.1.8.">In October 2013 the Government approved the GCIO risk and assurance framework for cloud computing, which agencies must follow when they are considering using cloud services [CAB Min (13) 37/6B]. &#xA0;It also directs that no data classified above RESTRICTED should be held in a public cloud, whether it is hosted onshore or offshore.</paragraph><paragraph title="22.1.9.">It is important to note that although agencies can outsource responsibility to a service provider for implementing, managing and maintaining security controls, they cannot outsource their accountability for ensuring their data is appropriately protected.</paragraph></block><block title="Background"><paragraph title="22.1.10.">The adoption of cloud technologies and services, the hosting of critical data in the cloud and the risk environment requires that agencies exercise caution. &#xA0;Many cloud users are driven by the need for performance, scalability, resource sharing and cost saving so a comprehensive risk assessment is essential in identifying and managing jurisdictional, sovereignty, governance, technical and security risks.</paragraph><paragraph title="22.1.11.">Typically agencies and other organisations start with a small, private cloud, allowing technical and security architectures, management processes and security controls to be developed and tested and gain some familiarity with cloud technologies and processes. &#xA0;These organisations then progress by using non-critical data, for example email, and other similar applications, in a hybrid, private or public cloud environment.</paragraph><paragraph title="22.1.12.">There are a number of technical risks associated with cloud computing, in addition to the existing risks inherent in organisational systems. &#xA0;Attention must also be paid to the strategic, governance and management risks of cloud computing. &#xA0;Security architecture and security controls also require careful risk assessment and consideration.</paragraph><paragraph title="22.1.13.">Cloud service providers will invariably seek to limit services, liability, compensation or penalties through carefully worded service contracts, which may present particular risks.</paragraph><paragraph title="22.1.14.">Much has been made of the operational cost savings related to cloud technologies, particularly a lower cost of operating. &#xA0;Less obvious are the risks and related cost of managing risk to an acceptable level. &#xA0;It is important to note that short term overall cost increases may, in some cases, be attributed to the adoption of cloud technologies and architectures.</paragraph><paragraph title="22.1.15.">Some valuable work in mapping the cloud risk landscape has been undertaken by such organisations as the Cloud Security Alliance, the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the UK&#x2019;s Cloud Industry Forum and the European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA). &#xA0;It is important to note that the extent of the risk landscape continues to evolve and expand.</paragraph></block><block title="Scope"><paragraph title="22.1.16.">This section provides information and some guidance on the risks associated with cloud computing, its implementation and ongoing use. &#xA0;Some controls are specified but agencies will necessarily undertake their own comprehensive risk assessment and select controls to manage those risks.</paragraph></block></subsection><subsection title="References - Guidance"><paragraph title="22.1.17.">While NOT an exhaustive list, further information on Cloud can be found at:

Term


Meaning




802.11


The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers standard defining WLAN communications. Formally titled IEEE 82.11.




Access Gateway


An architectural construct that provides the system user access to multiple security domains from a single device, typically a workstation.




Accountable


Required or&#xA0;expected to justify actions or decisions; being answerable and responsible for those actions &amp; decisions.




Accountable Material


Accountable information, an accountable item or accountable material refers to the accountability controls applied to specified information, equipment or materials. Accountable information, items or materials are usually uniquely identifiable (usually a serial or identification number) and are tracked from acquisition or creation to final disposal. Safe custody is a fundamental and is achieved through:

is easily to compute;
will usually output a significantly different value, even for small changes made to the input; and
can detect many types of data corruptions.
allocation to a specific individual (issued or responsibility designated);
allocation or designation of responsibility may also require a specific briefing related to the handling, care and protection of particular types of classified information and COMSEC equipment;
the allocation, issue or designation being recorded;
strict controls over access and movement (special handling requirements);
maintenance of a register (manual or electronic); and
regular audits to ensure accountability conditions continue to be adhered to and any briefings are current.

As a general rule, accountable information, items or materials are afforded physical security protection by specifying special handling and accountability conditions. Examples may include cryptographic or COMSEC equipment, other high value equipment, money, computers or information subject to privacy legislation and regulation. Cryptographic or COMSEC equipment and any information classified as CONFIDENTIAL, SECRET or TOP SECRET is accountable by definition.




Accountability


Most contemporary definitions include two key elements:

the conferring of responsibility and authority; and
the answering for the use of that authority.

Accountability exists when the performance of tasks or functions by an individual or organisation, are subject to another&#x2019;s oversight, direction or request that they provide information or justification for their actions.
Answering for the use of authority means reporting, explaining actions, assuming obligations, and submitting to outside or external judgement. &#xA0;Having responsibility means having the authority to act, the power to control and the freedom to decide.&#xA0; It also means that one must behave rationally, reliably and consistently in exercising judgement.




Accreditation


A procedure by which an authoritative body gives formal recognition, approval and acceptance of the associated residual security risk with the operation of a system and issues a formal approval to operate the system.




Accreditation Authority


The authoritative body or individual responsible for systems accreditation.




Adaptive Authentication


This varies the level or degree of authentication required where unusual login requests occur.&#xA0; For example, out of normal hours, from an unusual geolocation, from an unknown device and so on.&#xA0; When an unusual authentication request is received, Adaptive Authentication may request additional credentials such as a one-time code provided to a known mobile phone number.




Agency


New Zealand Government departments, authorities, agencies or other bodies established in relation to public purposes, including departments and authorities staffed under the Public Service Act.




Agency Control


This description applies where an Agency has direct control of agency information systems and data.&#xA0; It follows that Non-Agency Control occurs where direct control is impaired or does not or cannot exist.




Agency&#xA0;Head


The government employee with ultimate responsibility for the secure operation of agency functions, whether performed inhouse or outsourced.




All-of-Government


Refers to the entire New Zealand state sector.




Application Whitelisting


An approach in which all executables and applications are prevented from executing by default, unless explicitly permitted.




Approved Cryptographic Algorithms


Approved cryptographic algorithms have been extensively scrutinised for vulnerabilities by government, industry and academic communities in a practical and theoretical setting. The approved cryptographic algorithms fall into three categories: asymmetric/public key algorithms, hashing algorithms, and symmetric encryption algorithms.&#xA0;




Approved Destruction Facility


The status of &#x201C;approved facility&#x201D; for the destruction of media and equipment, applies to a specific installation/site, and is granted by the Director-General GCSB under the NZISM.
Approval depends upon the Director-General&#x2019;s satisfaction that the proposed facilities are capable of securely destroying IT equipment, devices and media to the standard required under the NZISM and related policies and that procedural security meets the required standards.




Asset


Anything of value to an agency, such as IT equipment and software, information, personnel, documentation, reputation and public confidence.




Attack Surface


The IT equipment and software used in a system. The greater the attack surface the greater the chances are of an attacker finding an exploitable vulnerability.




Audit


A structured process of examination, review, assessment, testing and reporting against defined requirements or objectives. Auditors should be independent of any IT system, business process, agency, function, site, supplier or other subject area being audited.




Australasian Information Security Evaluation Program


A program under which evaluations are performed by impartial companies against the Common Criteria.&#xA0; The results of these evaluations are then certified by ASD, which is responsible for the overall operation of the program.




Authentication


The process of identifying an individual, device or system before granting access to system resources or data.&#xA0; Usually based on a set of credentials such as an identifier (such as a user or device name) and an authenticator (such as a password or some other authentication factor).&#xA0; Authentication is distinct from Authorisation.




Authentication Header


Part of the protocol used for authentication within IPSec, it provides authentication, integrity and anti-replay for the entire packet (both the header and data payload).




Authorisation


Authorisation is the process of granting (or revoking) access privileges to an individual, device or system.&#xA0;&#xA0;




Baseline


Information and controls that are used as a minimum implementation or starting point to provide a consistent minimum standard of systems security and information assurance.




Blacklist


A set of items to be excluded, blocked or prevented from execution. A Blacklist can also be known as a Deny List or Block List. It is the opposite of a Whitelist (Allow List) which confirms that items are acceptable.




Brute Force Attack


A brute force attack is when an automated continuous attack is conducted against a system or file to decrypt or discover passwords and data.&#xA0; Often used as an entry point for privilege escalation.




Bug Bounty


A monetary reward to researchers for the discovery and reporting of software and other information system vulnerabilities.




Cascaded Connections


Links to other systems that occur when connected systems are themselves connected to other systems. This may result in multiple indirect (cascaded) connections to systems with differing security implementations, data, equipment and other aspects important for the security and assurance of systems.




Caveat


A marking that indicates that the information has special requirements in addition to those indicated by the classification and any prescribed endorsement. The term covers codewords, source codewords, releasability indicators and special-handling caveats. See also Endorsements.




Certification


The process by which the controls and management of an information system is formally evaluated against any specific risks identified and the requirements of the NZISM. A key output is a formal assurance statement that the system conforms to the requirements of the NZISM.




Certification Authority


An official with the authority to assert that a system complies with prescribed controls within a standard.




Certification Report


A report generated by a certification body of a Common Criteria scheme that provides a summary of the findings of an evaluation.




Characterisation


In the NZISM &#x201C;characterisation&#x201D; is a synonym for &#x201C;unique identifier&#x201D;.
This is typically applied to an operating system,&#xA0; programme, library or other programmatic element in the form of a checksum which can be calculated from a &#x201C;known good&#x201D; component and stored for comparison should there be any concern that components have been damaged or compromised.&#xA0;
Forensic methods may also provide characterisation indicators but are likely to require additional levels of expertise.
See also Checksum and Hash.




Checksum


A checksum verifies or checks the integrity of data.
A good checksum algorithm:

is easily to compute;
will usually output a significantly different value, even for small changes made to the input; and
can detect many types of data corruptions.

Checksums are often used to verify the integrity of operating system, programme, library or other programmatic elements, images and firmware updates.&#xA0; Checksums typically range in length from one to 64-bits, depending on the intended usage and algorithm used to determine the checksum.
Checksums are related to hash functions, fingerprints, randomisation functions, and cryptographic hash functions.&#xA0; Note, however, each of those concepts are distinct, have different applications and therefore different design goals.&#xA0; Check digits and parity bits are special uses of checksums.&#xA0; It is important to recognise that, although related, a hash is not a checksum.
See also Hash.




Chief Information Security Officer


A senior executive with overall responsibility for the governance and management of information risks within an agency. This may include coordination between security, ICT and business functions to ensure risks are properly identified and managed.




Classified Information


Government information that requires protection from unauthorised disclosure.




Classified Systems


Systems that process, store or communicate classified information.




Codewords


A short (usually a single word) descriptions of a project, operation or activity, typically assigned used for reasons of reliability, clarity, brevity, or secrecy. Each code word is assembled in accordance with the specific rules of the code and assigned a unique meaning. Synonymous with Codename.




Coercivity


A measure of the resistance of a magnetic material to changes in magnetisation, equivalent to the field intensity necessary to demagnetise any magnetised material. The amount of coercive force required to reduce any residual magnetic induction to zero. Normally used in describing the characteristics of degaussing magnetic media (see Degausser).




Common Criteria

Encryption


The transformation of data from plaintext (recognisable/readable data) to ciphertext (encrypted and not readable) using a cryptographic key.
Data is encrypted using an encryption key to produce ciphertext and decrypted to plaintext using a decryption key.&#xA0; These keys may be the same (symmetric encryption) or two different keys (asymmetric encryption).
Encryption alone does not prevent interference or unauthorised access but denies the intelligible content to unauthorised individuals, organisations or other would-be interceptors.




Endorsement


Certain information may bear an endorsement marking in addition to a security classification. Endorsement markings are not security classifications in their own right and must not appear without a security classification. Endorsement markings are warnings that the information has special requirements in addition to those indicated by the security classification and should only be used when there is a clear need for special care.
Endorsement markings may indicate:

the specific nature of information;
temporary sensitivities;
limitations on availability; or
how recipients should handle or disclose information.

A generic term for any physical component of information and communication technology, including peripheral equipment and media used to process information.




Hardware Security Module


Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) are a device, card or appliance usually installed inside of a PC or server to provide cryptographic functions. HSM&#x2019;s are usually physically and electronically hardened to reduce the possibility of tampering or other interference.




Hash


A hash is the result of a one-way, cryptographic function that converts a data string of any length into a unique fixed-length bit string.&#xA0; Typically applied to passwords and messages to protect against loss and/or add resistance to attacks.
Hashing algorithms or functions are often are designed as a one-way cryptographic transformation so that it's impossible to reverse the hash process and reconstitute the original string.
The values returned by a hash function are variously described as hash values, hash codes, digests, or simply hashes.
One common use of a hash is a data structure called a hash table, widely used in computer software for indexing and rapid retrieval of database elements.
Note that a hash is not the same as data encryption although it does utilise cryptographic functions.
See also Checksum.




Hash Value


See Hash.&#xA0; Also known as "message digest".




Hashed Message Authentication Code Algorithms


In cryptography, a keyed-hash message authentication code (HMAC) is a specific type of message authentication code (MAC) using a cryptographic hash function and a cryptographic key.

Hybrid Hard Drives


Non-volatile magnetic media that use a cache to increase read and write speeds and reduce boot time.&#xA0; The cache is normally flash memory media or battery backed RAM.




Incident Response Plan


A plan for responding to information security incidents as defined by the individual agency.




Identity and Access Management


Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a framework of business processes, policies and technologies that enable and support the management of electronic or digital identities, authorisation, privileges and access to organisational resources.
Identity management deals with attributes related to a user (including people, machines, devices and systems).&#xA0;Access Management applies organisation processes, policies and security to enable and manage access.&#xA0;The two aspects are highly interdependent and are most effectively managed conjointly.&#xA0;An IAM framework is a key element in Privileged Access Management (PAM) and Zero Trust architectures.




Image persistence / Image retention


LCD/LED/OLED and plasma technologies can be susceptible to persistence or retention of an image or &#x201C;ghost&#x201D; image on the screen.&#xA0; This can also led to screen burn-in, as can occur in traditional CRT monitors.




Indirect Agency Control


In relation to the NZISM, Indirect agency control is when information, services or operations are not under the direct control of the agency. This may be through outsourcing of, ICT management or services, use of third party facilities such as data centre co-locations, or consumption of cloud services. See also Direct Control.
