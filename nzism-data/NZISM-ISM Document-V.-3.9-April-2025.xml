<paragraph
    title="1.1.4."


><![CDATA[<p>Information that is Official Information or protectively marked UNCLASSIFIED, IN-CONFIDENCE, SENSITIVE or RESTRICTED is subject to a single set of controls in this NZISM.  These are essential or minimum acceptable levels of controls (baseline controls) and have been consolidated into a single set for simplicity, effectiveness and efficiency.  </p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="1.1.5."


><![CDATA[<p>All baseline controls will apply to all government systems, related services and information. In addition, information classified CONFIDENTIAL, SECRET or TOP SECRET has further controls specified in this NZISM.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="1.1.6."


><![CDATA[<p>Where the category “All Classifications” is used to define the scope of rationale and controls in the Manual, it includes any information that is Official Information, UNCLASSIFIED, IN-CONFIDENCE, SENSITIVE, RESTRICTED, CONFIDENTIAL, SECRET, TOP SECRET or any endorsements, releasability markings or other qualifications appended to these categories and classifications.</p>]]></paragraph>

<block title="The New Zealand Government Security Classification System"><paragraph
    title="1.1.12."


><![CDATA[<p>The requirements for classification of government documents and information are based on the <strong>Cabinet Committee Minute EXG (00) M 20/7</strong> and <strong>CAB (00) M42/4G(4)</strong>. &nbsp;The Protective Security Requirements (PSR) <a title="PSR Mandatory requirements - Information Security" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.protectivesecurity.govt.nz/policy/information-security" target="_blank">INFOSEC2</a> require agencies to use the <a title="NZ Government Security Classification System" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://protectivesecurity.govt.nz/information-security/security-classification-system-and-handling-requirements/" target="_blank">NZ Government Security Classification System</a> and the NZISM for the classification, protective marking and handling of information assets. &nbsp;For more information on classification, protective marking and handling instructions, refer to the <a title="PSR" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://protectivesecurity.govt.nz" target="_blank">Protective Security Requirements</a>, <a title="NZ Government Security Classification System" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://protectivesecurity.govt.nz/information-security/security-classification-system-and-handling-requirements/" target="_blank">NZ Government Security Classification System</a>.</p>]]></paragraph>

<subsection title="Key definitions"> <block title="Accreditation Authority"><paragraph
    title="1.1.13."


><![CDATA[<p>The Agency Head is generally the Accreditation Authority for that agency for all systems and related services up to and including those classified RESTRICTED. &nbsp;See also <a title="Roles &amp; responsibilities" href="http://nzism.gcsb.govt.nz/ism-document#Chapter-12255">Chapter 3 – Roles and Responsibilities</a> and <a title="Accreditation framework" href="http://nzism.gcsb.govt.nz/ism-document#Section-12591">Section 4.4 – Accreditation Framework</a>.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="1.1.14."


><![CDATA[<p>Agency heads may choose to delegate this authority to a member of the agency’s executive.  The Agency Head remains accountable for ICT risks accepted and the information security of their agency. </p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="1.1.15."


><![CDATA[<p>In all cases the Accreditation Authority will be at least a senior agency executive who has an appropriate level of understanding of the security risks they are accepting on behalf of the agency.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="1.1.16."


><![CDATA[<p>For multi-national and multi-agency systems the Accreditation Authority is determined by a formal agreement between the parties involved. &nbsp;Consultation with the <a title="Government Chief Digital Officer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.digital.govt.nz/digital-government/leadership" target="_blank">Office of the Government Chief Digital Officer (GCDO)</a> may also be necessary.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="1.1.17."


><![CDATA[<p>For agencies with systems that process, store or communicate NZEO or information compartmented for national security reasons, the Director-General of the GCSB is the Accreditation Authority irrespective of the classification level of that information<em>.</em></p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Certification and Accreditation Processes"><paragraph
    title="1.1.18."


><![CDATA[<p>Certification and accreditation of information systems is the fundamental governance process by which the risk owners and agency head derive assurance over the design, implementation and management of information systems and related services provided to or by government agencies. &nbsp; This process is described in detail in <a title="System certification &amp; accreditation" href="http://nzism.gcsb.govt.nz/ism-document#Chapter-12459">Chapter 4 – System Certification and Accreditation</a>.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="1.1.19."


><![CDATA[<p>Certification and Accreditation are two distinct processes.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="1.1.20."


><![CDATA[<p>Certification is the formal assertion that an information system and related services comply with minimum standards and agreed design, including any security requirements.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="1.1.21."


><![CDATA[<p><em>In all cases</em>, certification and the supporting documentation or summary of other evidence will be prepared by, or on behalf of, the host or lead agency.  The certification is then provided to the Accreditation Authority.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="1.1.22."


><![CDATA[<p>Accreditation is the formal authority to operate an information system and related services, and requires the recognition and acceptance of associated risk and residual risks.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="1.1.23."


><![CDATA[<p>A waiver is NOT an exception (see below).  A waiver is the formal acknowledgement that a particular compliance requirement of the NZISM cannot currently be met.  A waiver is granted by the Accreditation Authority on the basis that full compliance with the NZISM is achieved or compensating controls are implemented within a time specified by the Accreditation Authority.  Waivers are valid in the short term only and full accreditation cannot be granted until all conditions of the waiver have been met.  The need for a waiver may occur when specified controls cannot be practically implemented because of technology, resource or other serious limitations.  It is essential that risk is managed through the application of specified conditions.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="1.1.24."


><![CDATA[<p>An exception is NOT a waiver (see preceding paragraph).  An exception is the formal acknowledgement that a requirement of the NZISM cannot be met and that a dispensation from the particular compliance requirement is granted by the Accreditation Authority.  This exception is valid for the term of the Accreditation Certificate or some lesser time as determined by the Accreditation Authority.  This may occur, for example, the system is to be in use for a very short time (usually measured in hours), or the requirement cannot be met and there is no viable alternative.  It is essential that any consequential risk is acknowledged and appropriate measures are taken to manage any increased risk.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="1.1.25."


><![CDATA[<p>The requirements described above are <strong>summarised</strong> in the table below.  Care MUST be taken when using this table as there are numerous endorsements, caveats and releasability instructions in the <a title="Classification system" href="https://protectivesecurity.govt.nz/classification-system/" target="_blank">New Zealand Government Security Classification System</a><a title="NZ Government Security Classification System" href="https://www.protectivesecurity.govt.nz/information-security/security-classification-system-and-handling-requirements/" target="_blank"></a> that may change where the authority for accreditation lies.</p><table class="table-main">

<subsection title="Interpretation of controls"> <block title="Controls language"><paragraph
    title="1.1.40."


><![CDATA[<p>The definition of controls in this manual is based on language as defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)’s Request For Comment (RFC) 2119 to indicate differing degrees of compliance.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Applicability of controls"><paragraph
    title="1.1.41."


><![CDATA[<p>Whilst this manual provides controls for specific technologies, not all systems will use all of these technologies.  When a system is developed, the agency will determine the appropriate scope of the system and which controls within this manual are applicable.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="1.1.42."


><![CDATA[<p>If a control within this manual is outside the scope of the system then non-compliance processes <em>do not apply</em>.  However, if a control is within the scope of the system yet the agency chooses <em>not to implement</em> the control, then they are required to follow the non-compliance procedures as outlined below in order to provide appropriate governance and assurance.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="1.1.43."


><![CDATA[<p>The procedures and controls described in the NZISM are designed, not only to counter or prevent known common attacks, but also to protect from emerging threats.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Identification and Selection of controls"><paragraph
    title="1.1.44."


><![CDATA[<p>In all cases controls have been selected as the most effective means of mitigating identified risks and threats.  Each control has been carefully researched and risk assessed against a wide range of factors, including useability, threat levels, likelihood, rapid technology changes, sustainability, effectiveness and cost.  </p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Controls with a “MUST” or “MUST NOT” requirement"><paragraph
    title="1.1.45."


><![CDATA[<p>A control with a “MUST” or “MUST NOT” requirement indicates that use, or non-use, of the control is essential in order to effectively manage the identified risk, unless the control is demonstrably not relevant to the respective system.  These controls are baseline controls, sometimes described as systems hygiene controls.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="1.1.46."


><![CDATA[<p>The rationale for non-use of baseline controls MUST be clearly demonstrated to the Accreditation Authority as part of the certification process, before approval for exceptions is granted.  MUST and MUST NOT controls take precedence over SHOULD and SHOULD NOT controls.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Controls with a “SHOULD” or “SHOULD NOT” requirement"><paragraph
    title="1.1.47."


><![CDATA[<p>A control with a “SHOULD” or “SHOULD NOT” requirement indicates that use, or non-use, of the control is considered good and recommended practice. Valid reasons for not implementing a control could exist, including:</p><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>A control is not relevant in the agency;</li>
<li>A system or ICT capability does not exist in the agency; or </li>
<li>A process or control(s) of equal strength has been substituted.</li>
</ol>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="1.1.48."


><![CDATA[<p>While some cases may require a simple record of fact, agencies must recognise that non-use of any control, without due consideration, may increase residual risk for the agency. This residual risk needs to be agreed and acknowledged by the Accreditation Authority. In particular an agency should pose the following questions:</p><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>Is the agency willing to accept additional risk?</li>
<li>Have any implications for All-of-Government systems been considered?</li>
<li>If, so, what is the justification?</li>
</ol>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="1.1.49."


><![CDATA[<p>A formal auditable record of this consideration and decision is required as part of the IA governance and assurance processes within an agency.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Non-compliance"><paragraph
    title="1.1.50."


><![CDATA[<p>Non-compliance is a risk to the agency and may also pose risks to other agencies and organisations.  Good governance requires these risks are clearly articulated, measures are implemented to manage and reduce the identified risks to acceptable levels, that the Accreditation Authority is fully briefed, acknowledges any residual and additional risk and approves the measures to reduce risk. </p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="1.1.51."


><![CDATA[<p>In some circumstances, full compliance with this manual may not be possible, for example some legacy systems may not support the configuration of particular controls.  In such circumstances, a risk assessment should clearly identify <em>compensating</em> controls to reduce risks to an acceptable level.  Acceptance of risk or residual risk, without due consideration is NOT adequate or acceptable.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="1.1.52."


><![CDATA[<p>It is recognised that agencies may not be able to immediately implement all controls described in the manual due to resource, budgetary, capability or other constraints.  Good practice risk management processes will acknowledge this and prepare a timeline and process by which the agency can implement all appropriate controls described in this manual.  </p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="1.1.53."


><![CDATA[<p>Simply acknowledging risks and not providing the means to implement controls <em>does not</em> represent effective risk management.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="1.1.54."

</block>
<block title="Rationale Statements"><paragraph

<subsection title="Risk management"> <block title="Risk Management Standards"><paragraph
    title="1.1.56."


><![CDATA[<p>For security risk management to be of true value to an agency it MUST relate to the specific circumstances of an agency and its systems, as well as being based on an industry recognised approach or risk management guidelines. For example, guidelines and standards produced by <a title="Standards NZ" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://standards.govt.nz/" target="_blank">Standards New Zealand</a> and the <a title="International Organization for Standardization" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.iso.org/home.html" target="_blank">International Organization for Standardization (ISO).</a></p>]]></paragraph>

><![CDATA[<p>The NZISM contains guidance on governance and assurance processes and technological controls based on comprehensive risk and threat assessments, research and environmental monitoring.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="1.1.61."


><![CDATA[<p>The NZISM encourages agencies to take a similar risk-based approach to information security.  This approach enables the flexibility to allow agencies to conduct their business and maintain resilience in the face of a changing threat environment, while recognising the essential requirements and guidance provided by the NZISM.</p>]]></paragraph>

<subsection title="Context"> <block title="Scope"><paragraph
    title="1.2.2."


><![CDATA[<p>The NZISM provides guidance and specific ICT controls that form part of a suite of requirements produced by GCSB relating to information security.  Its role is to promote a consistent approach to information assurance and information security across all New Zealand Government agencies.  It is based on security risk assessments for any information that is processed, stored or communicated by government systems with corresponding risk treatments (control sets) to reduce the level of security risk to an acceptable level.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Applicability"><paragraph
    title="1.2.3."


><![CDATA[<p>The NZISM applies to information and systems operated by, or on behalf of:</p>
<ul>
<li>New Zealand Government departments, agencies and organisations as listed in:
<ul>
<li>Parts 1 and 2 of Schedule 1 to the Ombudsmen Act 1975 (as amended); and</li>
<li>Schedule 1 to the Official Information Act 1982.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>any other organisations that have entered into a formal Agreement with the New Zealand Government to have access to classified information.</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Authority"><paragraph
    title="1.2.4."


><![CDATA[<p>The Intelligence and Security Act 2017 provides that one of the functions of the GCSB is to co-operate with, and provide advice and assistance to, any public authority whether in New Zealand or overseas, or to any other entity authorised by the Minister responsible for the GCSB on any matters relating to the protections, security and integrity of communications; and information structures of importance to the Government of New Zealand.  The NZISM is one aspect of the GCSB’s advice and assistance to government agencies on information security. </p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="1.2.5."


><![CDATA[<p>This function furthers the objective of the GCSB to contribute to:</p><ul>
<li>The national security of New Zealand; and</li>
<li>The international relations and well-being of New Zealand; and</li>
<li>The economic well-being of New Zealand.</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="1.2.6."


><![CDATA[<p>The NZISM is intended to structure and assist the implementation of government policy that requires departments and agencies to protect the privacy, integrity and confidentiality of the information they collect, process, store and archive.  While these overarching requirements are mandatory for departments and agencies, compliance with the NZISM is not required as a matter of law.  The controls in the NZISM could be made binding on departments and agencies, either by legislation, or Cabinet direction.</p>]]></paragraph>

    title="1.2.7."


><![CDATA[<p>The <a title="PSR Framework" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.protectivesecurity.govt.nz/policy" target="_blank">Protective Security Requirements Framework</a> provides a specific authority and mandate through a Cabinet Directive <strong>CAB MIN (14) 39/38.</strong></p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="1.2.8."


><![CDATA[<p>The NZISM is published by the Government Chief Information Security Officer (GCISO). See 2.1.20 for more information about the GCISO.&nbsp;The GCISO mandate:</p>
<ul>
<li>confirms the GCISO's ability to set information security standards for GCISO mandated agencies;</li>
<li>clarifies the expectation for the GCISO to set assurance activities, and develop assurance methodologies, to meet standards and guidelines;</li>
<li>confirms GCISO access to information security investment information (along with joint System Leads for Data and Digital) from GCISO mandated agencies, including baseline spending; and</li>
<li>confirms the expectation of the GCISO to provide investment advice and guidance to the government on cyber security matters for the public sector.</li>

<block title="Compliance by smaller agencies"><paragraph
    title="1.2.10."

<paragraph
    title="1.2.11."


><![CDATA[<p>In such circumstances smaller agencies may choose to either operate on systems fully hosted by another agency using their information security policies and information security resources or share information security resources to jointly develop information security policies and systems for use by both agencies. &nbsp;The requirements within the NZISM can be interpreted as either relating to the host agency or to both agencies, depending on the approach taken.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="1.2.10."


><![CDATA[<p>In situations where agencies choose a joint approach to compliance, especially when an agency agrees to fully host another agency, the agency heads may choose to seek a memorandum of understanding regarding their information security responsibilities.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Legislation and other government policy"><paragraph
    title="1.2.13."

><![CDATA[<p>In the context of this section, outsourcing is defined as contracting an outside entity to provide essential business functions and processes that could be undertaken by the Agency itself.</p><p>Outsourcing may present elevated levels of risk and additional risks. Outsourcing therefore, requires greater consideration, demonstrable governance, and higher levels of assurance before committing to such contracts.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="2.2.5.R.02."

    tags="Governance"


><![CDATA[<p>A distinction is drawn between important business functions and the purchase of services such as power, water, building maintenance, stationery and telecommunications. These services are not usually provided by the agency itself.</p><p>Purchased services, as identified above, do NOT require accreditation or a third party review as defined in the NZISM. However, normal contract due diligence should be exercised before committing to these supply contracts.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="2.2.5.R.03."

    tags="Governance"


><![CDATA[<p>Contractors can be provided with classified information as long as their systems are accredited to an appropriate classification in order to process, store and communicate that information. Contractors and all staff with access to the classified systems must also be cleared to the level of the information being processed. This ensures that when they are provided with classified information that it receives an appropriate level of protection.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="2.2.5.R.04."

    tags="Governance"


><![CDATA[<p>New Zealand, in common with most developed countries, has agreements with other nations on information exchange on a variety of topics, including arms control, border control, biosecurity, policing and national security. The lead agency in each sector will usually be the controlling agency for each agreement. While the detail and nature of these agreements is sometimes classified, the agreements invariably require the protection of any information provided, to the level determined by the originator. Agencies that receive such information will be fully briefed by the relevant controlling agency or authority, before information is provided. It is important to note that there is no single list or source of such agreements.</p>]]></paragraph>

<paragraph
    title="2.3.7."


><![CDATA[<p>In August 2013, the Government introduced their approach to cloud computing, establishing a ‘cloud first’ policy and an All-of-Government direction to cloud services development and deployment. &nbsp;This is enabled by the Cabinet Minute <strong>[CAB Min (13) 37/6B]</strong>. &nbsp;Under the ‘cloud first’ policy state service agencies are expected to adopt approved cloud services either when faced with new procurements, or a contract extension decision. &nbsp;</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="2.3.8."


><![CDATA[<p>Cabinet also incorporated the cloud risk assessment process into the system-wide ICT assurance framework <strong>[CAB Min (13) 20/13]</strong>.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="2.3.9."


><![CDATA[<p>The New Zealand Government ICT Strategy released in October 2015 requires agencies to outsource their IT functions using common capabilities and public cloud services where this was feasible and practical.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="2.3.10."


><![CDATA[<p>In 2014 The Government Chief Information Officer published Cloud Computing Information Security and Privacy Considerations.  This guidance is designed to assist agencies systematically identify, analyse, and evaluate information security and privacy risks related to individual public cloud services.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="2.3.11."


><![CDATA[<p>In July 2016, new measures were confirmed to accelerate the adoption of public cloud services by New Zealand’s government agencies.  The new measures complement existing policies and risk assessment processes and provide appropriate checks and balances.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Background"><paragraph
    title="2.3.12."


><![CDATA[<p>The adoption of cloud technologies and services, the hosting of critical data in the cloud and the risk environment requires that agencies exercise caution.  Many cloud users are driven by the need for performance, scalability, resource sharing and cost saving so a comprehensive risk assessment is essential in identifying and managing jurisdictional, sovereignty, governance, assurance, technical and security risks.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="2.3.13."


><![CDATA[<p>Security requirements and drivers in the cloud differ significantly from traditional data centre environments requiring new security models and architectures.  Key factors include:</p><ul>
<li>The dynamic nature of the cloud and its related infrastructure;</li>
<li>No customer ownership or control of infrastructure;</li>
<li>Limited visibility of architectures and transparency of operations; </li>
<li>Shared (multi-tenanted) physical and virtual environments; and</li>
<li>May require re-architecting of agency system to optimise use of cloud services.</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="2.3.14."


><![CDATA[<p>While there is potential for significant benefit, flexibility and cost saving, any use of cloud services carries risk.  All cloud computing decisions should be made on a case-by-case basis after a proper risk assessment, the agency technology architecture is developed and security is properly considered and incorporated.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="2.3.15."


><![CDATA[<p>There is also likely to be a significant mismatch in service-level agreements (SLAs) between existing systems and outsourcing arrangements and those of cloud-based services.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="2.3.16."


><![CDATA[<p>It is important to note that although agencies can outsource operational <strong>responsibilities</strong> to a service provider for implementing, managing and maintaining security controls, they cannot outsource their <strong>accountability</strong> for ensuring their data is appropriately protected, including any system or service decommissioning or termination.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="2.3.17."


><![CDATA[<p>The Government Chief Digital Officer (GCDO) has developed a risk and assurance framework for cloud computing, which agencies are required to follow when they are considering using cloud services. </p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Information Security and Zero Trust"><paragraph
    title="2.3.18."


><![CDATA[<p>Information security relates to the protection of information regardless of its form (electronic or physical).&nbsp; Within government, information security has traditionally been construed using the concepts of confidentiality, availability and integrity of information.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="2.3.19."


><![CDATA[<p class="NormS2C3">Relating these concepts to people who access, manage and use that information requires the use of methods to provide:</p><ul>
<li>Authentication;</li>
<li>Authorisation; and</li>
<li>Non-repudiation.</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="2.3.20."


><![CDATA[<p>With the growth of the internet and cloud services, the proliferation of data and the growth in malicious and cyber-criminal activities, older methods of enabling information security are “fragile”, can be fragmented, and are in some cases, ineffective.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="2.3.21."


><![CDATA[<p class="NormS2C3">Zero Trust is a security concept based around the idea that systems and users should not be given access to any information without verification, even when they are connected to internal networks.  Zero Trust looks to acknowledge that the previous concept and approach of using perimeter defences and providing free access within the secure perimeter is no longer practical or appropriate for securing information assets. As such, it should be replaced with robust authentication and verification steps being continuously performed.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="2.3.22."


><![CDATA[<p class="NormS2C3">The concept of Zero Trust provides a more complete means of providing information security in an internet and cloud environment.  Understanding, planning for and preparing to adopt cloud services is an ideal time to incorporate Zero Trust concepts and principles into an agency’s information security policies, operations and information handling, processing storage and disposal.</p>]]></paragraph>

</block>
<block title="The Process"><paragraph
    title="4.1.4."


><![CDATA[<p>Certification and Accreditation is a fundamental governance and assurance process, designed to provide the Board, Chief Executive and senior executives confidence that information and its associated technology are well-managed, that risks are properly identified and mitigated and that governance responsibilities can demonstrably be met. It is essential for credible and effective information assurance governance.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="4.1.5."


><![CDATA[<p>C&amp;A has two important stages where certification must be completed before accreditation can take place. It is based on an assessment of risk, the application of controls described in the NZISM and determination of any residual risk.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="4.1.6."


><![CDATA[<p>Certification and Accreditation are separate and distinct elements, demonstrate segregation of duties and assist in managing any potential conflicts of interest. These are important attributes in good governance systems.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="4.1.7."


><![CDATA[<p>The acceptance of residual risk lies with the Chief Executive of each agency, or lead agency where sector, multi-agency or All-of-Government (AoG) systems are implemented.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="4.1.8."


><![CDATA[<p>An exception applies where High Assurance Cryptographic Equipment (HACE) is required or caveated or compartmented information is processed, stored or communicated. In this case the Director-General, GCSB is the Accreditation Authority.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="4.1.9."


><![CDATA[<p>The complete C&amp;A process has several elements and stages, illustrated in the Block Diagram at the end of this section.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Key Participants"><paragraph
    title="4.1.10."


><![CDATA[<p>There are four groups of participants:</p><ul>
<li><strong>System Owners</strong>, responsible for the design, development, system documentation and system maintenance, including any requests for recertification or reaccreditation.</li>
<li>The <strong>Certification Authority</strong>, responsible for the review of information and documentation provided by the system owner to ensure the ICT system complies with minimum standards and the agreed design.</li>
<li>The <strong>Assessor</strong> or Auditor, who will conduct inspections, audits and review as instructed by the Certification Authority.</li>
<li>The <strong>Accreditation Authority</strong> will consider the recommendation of the Certification Authority. If the level of residual risk is acceptable, the Accreditation Authority will issue the system accreditation (the formal authority to operate a system).</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Certification"><paragraph
    title="4.1.11."


><![CDATA[<p>Certification is the assertion that an ICT system including any related or support services such as Telecommunications or cloud comply with the minimum standards and controls described in the NZISM, any relevant legislation and regulation and other relevant standards. It is based on a comprehensive evaluation or systems audit. This process is described in <a title="Conducting certifications" href="http://nzism.gcsb.govt.nz/ism-document#Section-12507">Section 4.2 – Conducting Certifications</a>.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="4.1.12."


><![CDATA[<p>Certification is evidence that due consideration has been paid to risk, security, functionality, business requirements and is a fundamental part of information systems governance and assurance.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Certification Authorities"><paragraph
    title="4.1.13."


><![CDATA[<p>For all agency information systems the certification authority is the CISO unless otherwise delegated by the Agency Head.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="4.1.14."


><![CDATA[<p>For external organisations or service providers supporting agencies, the certification authority is the CISO of the agency.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="4.1.15."


><![CDATA[<p>For multi-national, multi-agency, and AoG systems the certification authority is determined by a formal agreement between the parties involved. Within NZ this is usually the lead agency.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Accreditation"><paragraph
    title="4.1.16."


><![CDATA[<p>Accreditation is the formal authority to operate a system, evidence that governance requirements have been addressed and that the Chief Executive has fulfilled the requirement to manage risk on behalf of the organisation and stakeholders. This element of the C&amp;A process is described in <a title="Accreditation framework" href="http://nzism.gcsb.govt.nz/ism-document#Section-12591">Section 4.4 – Accreditation Framework</a>.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="4.1.17."


><![CDATA[<p>Accreditation ensures that either sufficient security measures have been put in place to protect information that is processed, stored or communicated by the system or that deficiencies in such measures have been identified, assessed and acknowledged, including the acceptance of any residual risk.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Accreditation Authority"><paragraph
    title="4.1.18."


><![CDATA[<p>For agencies the Accreditation Authority is the agency head or their formally authorised delegate.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="4.1.19."


><![CDATA[<p>For multi-national, multi-agency systems or AoG systems, the Accreditation Authority is determined by a formal agreement between the parties involved.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="4.1.20."


><![CDATA[<p>In all cases the Accreditation Authority will be at least a senior executive who has an appropriate level of understanding of the security risks they are accepting on behalf of the agency.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="4.1.21."


><![CDATA[<p>Depending on the circumstances and practices of an agency, the agency head could choose to delegate their authority to multiple senior executives who have the authority to accept security risks for the specific business functions within the agency.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Conflicts of Interest"><paragraph
    title="4.1.22."


><![CDATA[<p>A conflict of interest is a situation in which a person has duties or responsibilities to more than one person, organisation or elements of a process, but is placed in a position where they cannot do justice to all. This includes, for example, when an individual's vested interests or concerns are inconsistent with organisational outcomes, or when an official has conflicting responsibilities. In the context of the C&amp;A process, a conflict of interest can occur when an individual has multiple roles, such as being both the system owner and the Accreditation Authority.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="4.1.23."


><![CDATA[<p>A conflict of interest has the potential to undermine impartiality and integrity of a process and the people involved in a process. It will also undermine the integrity of governance and information assurance derived from the C&amp;A process.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="4.1.24."


><![CDATA[<p>Conflicts of interest are normally managed though segregation of duties, the division of <strong>roles</strong> and <strong>responsibilities</strong> in order to reduce the ability or opportunity for an individual to compromise a critical process. Segregation of duties also reduces errors of interpretation or judgement and better manages risk.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="4.1.25."


><![CDATA[<p>It is important to note that in the C&amp;A process in the NZISM, the Certification Authority, System Owner and Accreditation Authority are <em>independent</em> of each other. In smaller agencies, the Assessor may also be the Certification Authority. Ideally this role will also be segregated.</p>]]></paragraph>

><![CDATA[<p>Penetration tests are an effective method of identifying vulnerabilities in a system or network, and testing existing security measures and the implementation of controls. Penetration testing is also very useful in validating the effectiveness of the defensive mechanisms. This testing provides an increased level of assurance when system certification and accreditation is undertaken. It also demonstrates prudent risk management.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="4.1.27."


><![CDATA[<p>A penetration test usually involves the use of intrusive methods or attacks conducted by trusted individuals, methods similar to those used by intruders or hackers. Care must be taken not to adversely affect normal operations while these tests are conducted.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="4.1.28."


><![CDATA[<p>Organisations may conduct their own tests and regular simple tests are effective in maintaining the organisation’s security posture. Because of the level of expertise required to effectively conduct more complex testing, comprehensive penetration tests are often outsourced to specialist organisations.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="4.1.29."


><![CDATA[<p>Penetration tests can range from simple scans of IP addresses in order to identify devices or systems offering services with known vulnerabilities, to exploiting known vulnerabilities that exist in an unpatched operating system, applications or other software. The results of these tests or attacks are recorded, analysed, documented and presented to the owner of the system. Any deficiencies should then be addressed.</p>]]></paragraph>

<block title="Audit evidence sufficiency"><paragraph
    title="4.3.13."


><![CDATA[<p class="NormS4C3">The Sufficiency is the measure of the quality (not the quantity) of audit evidence.  It is important, however, that a balance is struck between the extent of the audit, the nature of the system under review, agency risk and the cost, effort and benefit of the audit.  Sufficient evidence should be obtained to allow the auditor to be able to draw reasonable conclusions on which to base the audit opinion.  For evidence to be deemed sufficient, the following aspects should be considered:</p><ul>
<li>Materiality.  Materiality is the threshold where any distorted, missing and incorrect information is likely to have an impact on the risk and security of a system.  Where it becomes clear that there are material deficiencies in the evidence presented more substantive tests may be required or the audit suspended until corrective action has been taken by the agency.</li>
<li>Risk assessment: It is almost impossible to validate every risk identification and selection of risk treatments.  For larger systems a more practical approach may be to validate the identification and treatment of major risks and use sampling techniques for the balance.</li>
<li>Economy: Before gathering or requesting additional audit evidence, it is important to consider whether or not it is feasible or cost-effective to generate this evidence against the benefits, assessed value and time required.</li>

    tags="Governance"


><![CDATA[<p>To provide assurance to System Owners, Certifiers, Practitioners and Accreditors and to assist system designers, enterprise and security architects where assurance reviews cannot be directly undertaken on service providers.</p>]]></paragraph>
 </subsection>
<subsection title="Context "> <block title="Scope"><paragraph
    title="5.8.2."


><![CDATA[<p>Independent assurance reports are also variously referred to as third party assurance reporting, third party reviews, attestation reports and SAS 70 reports. It is important to note that SAS 70 has been superseded by the ISAE 3402 and SSAE 16 standards encompassing Type I and 2 and SOC 1, 2 and 3 reports. For reviews conducted in New Zealand the ISAE (NZ) 3402 or ISAE (NZ) 3000 standards are used. These various standards and report types are discussed later in this section. Agencies are likely to encounter a variety of report types, depending on the country of residence or country of jurisdiction of the service provider, or the geographic location of the data centre.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Purpose"><paragraph
    title="5.8.3."


><![CDATA[<p>Many organisations are outsourcing key components of their business such as telecommunications, data storage and cloud based services. Managing third-party relationships is particularly challenging with services provided from outside New Zealand. The global nature of these services and the global nature of associated risks must be recognised by organisations. As outsourced services are becoming more integrated with organisation’s operations, they will have a larger impact on organisation’s governance, assurance and control frameworks. It is important to note that risk ownership and accountability remains with agencies and respective risk owners, even when responsibility for specific functions have been outsourced.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="5.8.4."


><![CDATA[<p>Independent assurance reports provide customers and other interested parties with information on policies, procedures and controls related to the service provider’s internal frameworks, control objectives and controls in cases where physical inspections and reviews by customers are impractical or not feasible. Service providers may also use the findings of such reports for their own purposes. These reports are used to understand the adequacy and effectiveness of the service provider’s frameworks, control objectives, controls and implementation of controls. They allow:</p><ul>
<li>Business owners to identify and understand the risks associated with the service delivery;</li>
<li>System owners to more fully assess system risks;</li>
<li>System designers and security architects to make informed judgements on system structures, controls, defensive measures, and enterprise integration; and</li>
<li>Regulators, certifiers and accreditors to obtain assurance over the service providers internal control structures and assess the suitability of system structures, controls and defensive measures.</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="5.8.5."


><![CDATA[<p>An independent assurance review or third-party audit is invariably undertaken by independent auditors who are not employees of the service provider or their customers. There are two common types of independent third-party reviews: attestation reviews and direct non-attestation reviews.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="5.8.6."


><![CDATA[<p>Attestation reviews, such as an ISAE 3402 review (see below), are generally conducted by accounting or consulting organisations and are based upon recognised attestation standards issued by professional bodies such as the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) or the New Zealand External Reporting Board (XRB).</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="5.8.7."


><![CDATA[<p>Direct or non-attestation reviews include those performed by IT consultants or others and may not follow standards referred to previously. They may be based upon other external standards or industry developed criteria such as ISO 2700x, ISACA’s COBIT, the IIA, NIST, or the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA).</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Assurance"><paragraph
    title="5.8.8."


><![CDATA[<p>Assurance is derived from an assessment of:</p><ul>
<li>A description of the service provider’s business and control environment;</li>
<li>Terms and conditions of the service contract or other legally binding agreement;</li>
<li>Assertions supplied by the service provider (self-assessments);</li>
<li>An independent validation of service provider assertions;</li>
<li>Independent testing of controls implementation and effectiveness;</li>
<li>Assurance in the service design and security architecture; and</li>
<li>Assurance in the service components.</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="5.8.9."


><![CDATA[<p>In general terms, the more ICT services that are outsourced in an agency, the less direct control and visibility the CE and management have over enterprise operations. Therefore, there is an increased reliance on assurance reporting from suppliers.  Unless this is recognised in service contracts or legal agreements, agencies may find they are unable to obtain sufficient levels of assurance over the business services and enterprise operations.</p>]]></paragraph>

><![CDATA[<p>Based on its predecessor standard SAS 70 (1992), ISAE 3402 was developed to provide an international assurance standard for allowing public accountants to issue a report for use by user organisations and their auditors (user auditors) on the controls at a service organisation that are likely to impact or be a part of the user organisation’s system of internal control over financial reporting.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph

<block title="ISAE 3402 Report Types"><paragraph
    title="5.8.15."


><![CDATA[<p>The ISAE 3402 provides for a report on controls at a point in time (Type 1 Report) or covering a specified period of time, usually between six and twelve months (Type 2 Report).</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="5.8.16."


><![CDATA[<p>A Type 1 report is of limited use as it cannot cover the operating effectiveness of controls and is generally used for new operations where there is no evidence or documented history.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="5.8.17."


><![CDATA[<p>A Type 2 report not only includes the service organisation's description of controls, but also includes detailed testing of the service organisation's controls over a minimum six month period.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="5.8.18."


><![CDATA[<p>It is important to note that the descriptions Type 1 and Type 2 represent an audit approach and should not be confused with SOC 1, 2 and 3 reports under SSAE 16 (see below).</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="ISAE 3402 Report Uses and Limitations"><paragraph
    title="5.8.19."


><![CDATA[<p>This standard is used to obtain reasonable assurance about whether:</p><ul>
<li>The service organisation’s description of its system fairly presents the system as designed and implemented throughout a specified period or a specific date;</li>
<li>The controls related to the control objectives stated in the service organisation’s description of its system were suitably designed throughout the specified period or at the specified date;</li>
<li>Where included in the scope of the engagement, the controls were implemented and operated effectively to provide reasonable assurance that the control objectives stated in the service organisation’s description of its system were achieved throughout the specified period.</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="5.8.20."


><![CDATA[<p>This ISAE applies only when the service organisation is responsible for, or otherwise able to make an assertion about, the suitable design of controls. It does not cover situations where:</p><ul>
<li>reporting only whether controls at a service organisation operated as described; or</li>
<li>reporting on controls at a service organisation other than those related to a service relevant to user entities.</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="ISAE 3402 Report Content"><paragraph
    title="5.8.21."


><![CDATA[<p>The ISAE 3402 report usually comprises:</p><ul>
<li>The service auditor’s report;</li>
<li>Assertions by the service provider;</li>
<li>A description of control objectives and controls provided by the service organisation;</li>
<li>Results of any tests and other information provided by the independent auditor; and</li>
<li>Any other information provided by the service provider.</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>

<block title="US Standard SSAE 16"><paragraph
    title="5.8.22."


><![CDATA[<p>The Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements No. 16 (SSAE 16) is issued by the Auditing Standards Board (ASB) of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). It includes additional requirements to the superseded SAS 70 standard by requiring management to provide a written assertion (see below) regarding the design and operating effectiveness of the controls being reviewed. It is possible that agencies may encounter an SSAE16 based report for a US-based entity.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="5.8.23."


><![CDATA[<p>SSAE 16 is the US equivalent of the international ISAE 3402 and came into effect on<br>15 June 2011. While the SSAE 16 and ISAE 3402 standards have a common purpose and intent, , there are nine very specific requirements in SSAE 16, not covered in ISAE 3402:</p><ul>
<li>Intentional acts by the service providers staff;</li>
<li>Anomalies;</li>
<li>Direct assistance;</li>
<li>Subsequent events;</li>
<li>Statement restricting use of the service auditor’s report;</li>
<li>Disclaimer of Opinion;</li>
<li>Documentation completion;</li>
<li>Engagement acceptance and continuance; and</li>
<li>Elements of the SSAE 16 report that are not required in the ISAE 3402 report.</li>

><![CDATA[<p>The SSAE 16 standard specifies Type 1 and 2 audits (as does ISAE 3402).</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="5.8.26."


><![CDATA[<p>A Type 1 is a report on a description of a service organisation’s system and the suitability of the design of controls. A Type 1 report will test the design effectiveness of defined controls by examining a sample of one item per control. This provides a basic level of assurance that the organisation has some controls in place. It does not measure the completeness or effectiveness of these controls and represents a point in time.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="5.8.27."


><![CDATA[<p>A Type2 report is a report on policies and procedures placed in operation and tests of operating effectiveness for a specified period of time. A Type 2 report undertakes the tests in a Type 1 report together with an evaluation of the operating effectiveness of the controls for a period of at least six consecutive calendar months.</p>]]></paragraph>

<block title="AICPA Service Organisation Control Reporting (SOC Reports)"><paragraph
    title="5.8.28."


><![CDATA[<p>Service Organization Control (SOC) Reports, often known as SOC 1, SOC 2, and SOC 3 Reports, are derived from a framework published by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) for reporting on controls at service organisations.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="5.8.29."


><![CDATA[<p>In New Zealand, SOC 1 reports follow the ISAE (NZ) 3402 standard and SOC 2 reports are follow the ISAE (NZ) 3000 standard, in conjunction with the NZ Standard for Assurance Engagements SAE 3150, for assurance engagements on controls.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="5.8.30."


><![CDATA[<p>Each of the three SOC reports are designed to meet specific needs and reporting requirements for service organisations themselves, rather than being designed to provide assurance to third parties (customers). It is important to note that these reports follow the US (SSAE 16) and Canadian accounting standards, rather than the international ISAE 3402.</p><p><strong>SOC 1 Report – Report on Controls at a Service Organization Relevant to User Entities’ Internal Control over Financial Reporting.</strong> Reporting on controls relevant to internal control over financial reporting and usually conducted in accordance with Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE) No. 16 and AT 801 – Reporting on Controls at a Service Organization. A SOC 1 report can be based on a Type 1 or a Type 2 audit.</p><p><strong>SOC 2 Report— Report on Controls at a Service Organization Relevant to Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality or Privacy.</strong> SOC 2 Reporting follows the AICPA AT Section 101 (not SSAE 16) and encompasses controls at service organisations on security, availability, processing Integrity, confidentiality and privacy. SOC 2 reports assist in comparing two or more data centres or service providers.</p><p><strong>SOC 3 Report— Trust Services Report for Service Organizations.</strong> As well as reporting on controls relevant to security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality and privacy a SOC 3 report provides the same level of assurance about controls over security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality and/or privacy as a SOC 2 report. The key difference is that a SOC 3 report is intended for general release and does not include the detailed description of the testing performed by the auditor. In place of the detailed description a summary opinion regarding the effectiveness of the controls in place at the data centre or service organisation is provided.</p><p><strong>SOC Reports Summary</strong></p><table class="table-main">

<paragraph
    title="5.8.32."


><![CDATA[<p>The SSAE 16 requires a written assertion by management. Also known as a management’s assertion or service organisation assertion it is essentially an assertion made by the service organisation representing and asserting to a number of elements, including:</p><ul>
<li>The description fairly presents the service organisation's system;</li>
<li>That the control objectives were suitably designed (SSAE 16 Type 1) and operating effectively (SSAE 16 Type 2) during the dates and/or periods covered by the report; and</li>
<li>The criteria used for making these assertions, (which are additional statements with supporting matter regarding risk factors relating to control objectives and underlying controls) were in place (Type 1) and were consistently applied (Type 2).</li>

It provides a structured approach to assist in managing risk by identifying information security vulnerabilities and selecting appropriate controls.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="5.8.34."


><![CDATA[<p>This standard enables independent, external certification bodies to audit the ISMS and certify that the requirements of the standard have been met. Such certification is another means of deriving assurance over the operations of service providers. The requirements for certification are described in the ISO/IEC 27006:2015 standard. Certification is based on two reviews:</p><ul>
<li>Stage 1 audit (also called Documentation review) checking the systems documentation is compliant with ISO 27001;</li>
<li>Stage 2 audit (also called Main audit) checking that all the organisation’s activities are compliant with both ISO 27001 and the systems documentation.</li>

    title="5.8.35."


><![CDATA[<p>STAR Certification is a rigorous third party independent assessment of the security of a cloud service provider. It is based on the ISAE 3402 and SSAE 16 standards, supplemented by the criteria in the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM).</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="5.8.36."


><![CDATA[<p>STAR is a free, publicly accessible registry that documents the security controls provided by various cloud computing service providers. The registry lists three levels of assurance:</p><ol>
<li>Self-assessment;</li>
<li>Third party assessment based attestation or certification; and</li>
<li>Continuous monitoring based certification.</li>
</ol><p><b>Note: </b>Agencies should note that a self-assessment does not necessarily provide substantive assurance.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="5.8.37."


><![CDATA[<p>As at March 2017, the STAR scheme is still to be fully implemented although there are a number of cloud service providers listed in the registry.</p>]]></paragraph>

<paragraph
    title="5.8.40."


><![CDATA[<p>The CCM references and maps its controls to internationally accepted industry standards, regulations, and control frameworks, such as ISO 27001/2/17/18, PCI: DSS v3, and AICPA 2014 Trust Service Principles and Criteria, Germany’s BIS, Canada’s PIPEDA, ISACA’s COBIT, the US FedRAMP, HIPAA, Jericho Forum, NIST and the NZISM.</p>]]></paragraph>

<block title="ISACA IT Audit and Assurance Program for Cloud Computing "><paragraph
    title="5.8.42."


><![CDATA[<p>Based on ISACA’s IT Assurance Framework (ITAF), the Cloud Computing Assurance Program was developed as a comprehensive and good-practice model, aligned with the ISACA COBIT 5 framework. Building on the generic assurance program, the cloud computing guidance identifies a number of cloud specific risk areas encompassing:</p><ul>
<li>Greater dependency on third parties;</li>
<li>Increased complexity of compliance with national and international laws and regulations;</li>
<li>Reliance on the Internet as the primary conduit to the enterprise’s data; and</li>
<li>Risk due to the dynamic nature of cloud computing.</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="5.8.43."


><![CDATA[<p>The ITAF assurance focus is on:</p><ul>
<li>The governance affecting cloud computing;</li>
<li>The contractual compliance between the service provider and customer;</li>
<li>Privacy and regulation issues concerning cloud computing; and</li>
<li>Cloud computing specific attention points.</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="5.8.44."


><![CDATA[<p>It is important to note that this cloud computing assurance review is not designed to provide assurance on the design and operational effectiveness of the cloud computing service provider’s internal controls, as this assurance is often provided through ISAE 3604 or similar reviews.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="5.8.45."


><![CDATA[<p>The cloud computing assurance review focusses on the agency’s or organisation’s systems design and operational effectiveness in relation to cloud services. It is also important to note that this is dependent on the effectiveness of the underlying system design and controls and how well these are implemented and managed.</p>]]></paragraph>

<block title="ASD Certified Cloud Services"><paragraph
    title="5.8.46."


><![CDATA[<p>The Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) conducts certification of cloud services based in Australia for Australian government use. ASD Certifications are based on the Australian Government Information Security Manual (ISM). It is important to note that there are detail differences between the Australian ISM and the NZISM and these documents have a different legislative and regulatory basis.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="5.8.47."


><![CDATA[<p>The ASD Cloud Computing Security documents describe security risk mitigations associated with cloud computing.

<paragraph
    title="5.8.49."


><![CDATA[<p>The underlying mandates are in FIPS Publication 200, Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems and FIPS Publication 199, Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems. US federal government agencies are required to categorise and analyse their system in terms of FIPS 199 and 200 then apply appropriate controls from NIST 800-53.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="FedRAMP"><paragraph
    title="5.8.50."


><![CDATA[<p>The US Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) is a government-wide program intended to provide a standardised approach to security assessment, authorisation, and continuous monitoring for cloud products and services. This approach is designed to provide reusable cloud security assessments in order to reduce cost, resource and time. In addition it was intended to minimise cybersecurity risk for Federal Agencies as they move operations to the cloud, provide consistent baseline security policies and streamline the procurement process.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="5.8.51."


><![CDATA[<p>FedRAMP is a collaboration of cybersecurity and cloud experts from the General Services Administration (GSA), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Department of Defense (DOD), National Security Agency (NSA), Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the Federal Chief Information Officer (CIO) Council and its working groups, as well as private industry.</p><p>The FedRAMP programme is run by the FedRAMP Program Management Office as part of the GSA.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="5.8.52."


><![CDATA[<p>FedRAMP is mandatory for Federal Agency cloud deployments at all risk impact levels.  Private cloud deployments from single agencies and fully implemented within federal facilities are an exception to this mandate.  Quarterly reporting by each agency on their cloud portfolio is required.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="5.8.53."


><![CDATA[<p>FedRAMP authorises cloud systems in a three step process:</p><ol>
<li><strong>Security Assessment:</strong> The security assessment process uses a standardised set of requirements in accordance with FISMA using a baseline set of NIST 800-53 controls with additional controls specific to cloud deployments, in order to grant security authorisations. Cryptographic elements are governed by the FIPS 140-2 standards.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Leveraging and Authorisation:</strong> Federal agencies view security authorisation packages in the FedRAMP repository and leverage the security authorisation packages to grant a security authorisation at their own agency.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Ongoing Assessment &amp; Authorisation:</strong> Once an authorisation is granted, ongoing assessment and authorisation activities are required to maintain the security authorisation.</li>
</ol>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="5.8.54."


><![CDATA[<p>Again it is important to note that the FedRAMP assessments are conducted on a different legislative and regulatory basis to assessments conducted in New Zealand. A variety of guidance, controls, templates and other documentation is available online from the GSA (see References - Assurance Guidance )</p>]]></paragraph>

<block title="PCI DSS"><paragraph
    title="5.8.55."


><![CDATA[<p>The Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council was formed by major credit card organisations and is a global open body formed to develop and promote understanding of essential security standards for payment account security. It develops, maintains and promotes the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS). It also provides tools to assist the implementation of the standards such as assessment and scanning qualifications, self-assessment questionnaires, training and education, and product certification programs.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="5.8.56."


><![CDATA[<p>This standard is designed to protect cardholder data (credit and debit cards) held by merchants, banks and other financial organisations. It applies to all organisations that accept, store, process and transmit credit cardholder data.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="5.8.57."


><![CDATA[<p>This standard is narrowly focussed and has specific applicability to New Zealand Government agencies that operate financial transaction services (e.g. AoG Banking services and citizen fee-paying services; such as vehicle registration, passport renewal, etc.). The PCI has published an information supplement on Third-Party Security Assurance (updated March 2016).</p>]]></paragraph>

<block title="COSO"><paragraph
    title="5.8.58."


><![CDATA[<p>The Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) initially developed the COSO Internal Control-Integrated Framework in 1992. A revised framework was published in 2013 which included guidance on “outsourced service providers” and how they impact risk assessment, controls, monitoring, information flows and assurance. The 2013 Framework incorporates how organisations should manage IT innovation in light of globalisation, complex business processes, regulatory demands and security risk assessments. It is frequently used as the basis for SSAE16 assignments and the production of SOC reports.</p>]]></paragraph>

><![CDATA[<p>The Security Risk Management Plan (<a title="SRMP" href="http://nzism.gcsb.govt.nz/ism-document#Section-12761">SRMP – Section 5.3</a>) encompasses all risks associated with the security of agency systems. The growth in outsourced services, particularly cloud services, has created situations where risk, controls and assurance cannot be directly examined and assessed. In such cases independent assurance reports are an effective means, possibly the only means, of obtaining some assurance on the service provider’s operations.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="5.8.61.R.02."

    tags="Governance,Information Security Documentation,Risk Assessment,Assurance"


><![CDATA[<p>No single independent assurance scheme/standard covers the full range of considerations and control requirements of the NZISM. Agencies may find duplication of aspects analysed if multiple schemes are applied. It is also important to note that none of the common mature assurance schemes cover specific government requirements and handling of Official Information; such as the personnel aspects (PERSEC) of user and administration vetting and security clearances, or sovereignty aspects of the information/data. Careful selection and consideration is required when placing reliance on reports available for a particular outsourced or cloud service.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="5.8.61.R.03."

    tags="Governance,Information Security Documentation,Risk Assessment,Assurance"


><![CDATA[<p>Reports from different assurance scheme have varying levels of detail as well as risk area coverage. Selection and usage of reports should be considered in the context of the intended service/system business and information value.</p><p>Understanding the business and technical risk context will drive the size and depth of a risk assessment, and the associated assurance process. Though even a lighter-weight risk assurance process will follow the C&amp;A process model, such that the CE or authorised delegate is still formally accountable and responsible.</p><p>Re-use of assessments completed by other agencies is encouraged, noting the business or information value context may differ. To assist agencies and promote efficiency, the Government Chief Digital Officer (GCDO) facilitates the sharing and re-use of existing cloud assessment materials among agencies.</p>]]></paragraph>

<paragraph
    title="5.9.8."


><![CDATA[<p class="NormS5C9">Agencies should establish a process to allow any user (whether a member of the public, business partners, other agencies or agency staff), to report potential vulnerabilities.&nbsp; Any such reporting is on a “no blame” basis, without fear of repercussion or penalty, provided the agency’s disclosure policy is followed and no illegal activity is undertaken.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="5.9.9."


><![CDATA[<p class="NormS5C9">The VDP must clearly state the conditions under which reports are received.  In general terms this also includes a “no bug bounty” clause as well as limits on web site, system or application probing.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="5.9.10."


><![CDATA[<p class="NormS5C9">An agency’s VDP will necessarily reflect that they may not control or own all of the software they use or the maintenance and development of underlying software (such as compilers, programming or scripting languages and so on).  The VDP should clearly state that while the agency can receive reports about software, systems or services run on their behalf by third parties, providers or vendors, they may have to work with the reporting party to report the vulnerability to the relevant vendor.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="5.9.11."


><![CDATA[<p class="NormS5C9">Where specific legislation applies, for example a reported vulnerability may breach the Privacy Act, agencies must adhere to the legislation.  This may change how reports are managed and action communicated to the finder or reporter.  This does not change the requirement to maintain communication with the reporter/finder.</p>]]></paragraph>

<block title="Agencies are expected to find and remediate vulnerabilities"><paragraph
    title="5.9.12."


><![CDATA[<p class="NormS5C9">The Protective Security Requirements places clear expectations on agencies to maintain awareness of vulnerabilities (see <a title="PSR Mandatory requirements" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://protectivesecurity.govt.nz/information-security/mandatory-requirements-2/" target="_blank">mandatory requirement INFOSEC4</a>).</p>]]></paragraph>

<paragraph
    title="5.9.14."


><![CDATA[<p class="NormS5C9">The disclosure period commonly used by many vendors, manufacturers and government agencies is 90 days.  Vulnerabilities will be either patched, mitigated or managed within this period.  In some cases earlier notification is provided to allow users to take mitigating actions until a patch or other solution is available.</p>]]></paragraph>

</block>
<block title="Vulnerability disclosure policies are a normal part of learning about and patching vulnerabilities"><paragraph
    title="5.9.18."


><![CDATA[<p class="NormS5C9">Vulnerability disclosure (sometimes also referred to as responsible disclosure or coordinated vulnerability disclosure) is now an internationally accepted practice for technology organisations.  The practice of vulnerability disclosure in modern computing dates to the late 1980s.  There are related examples (non-computing) which appeared in the mid-1800s when locksmiths exchanged vulnerability information.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Bug Bounties"><paragraph
    title="5.9.19."


><![CDATA[<p class="NormS5C9">“Bug bounties” are a monetary reward to security researchers for the discovery and reporting of software and other information system vulnerabilities to the agency.  Bug Bounties are separate to VDPs and should only be covered if the agency has a bug bounty programme in place.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Vulnerability disclosure policy (VDP) Content"><paragraph
    title="5.9.20."


><![CDATA[<p class="NormS5C9">A VDP will typically include:</p><ul>
<li>A scoping statement setting out which systems the policy applies to (e.g. the agency’s website and other public-facing systems);</li>
<li>Details of how finders can contact the agency’s security team (including any public keys for encrypting reports);</li>
<li>Permitted activities;</li>
<li>Acknowledgement of reports and a response time (typically 60 or 90 days) for corrections, adjustments, or other “fixes”;</li>
<li>Reporters/finders agreeing to not share information about the vulnerability until the end of the disclosure period, to let the organisation fix the issues before it becomes public;</li>
<li>Illegal activities are not permitted (specifying any relevant legislation, such as the Crimes Act, the Privacy Act etc.); and</li>
<li>Either a statement that bug bounties will not be paid for any discoveries, or information about the agency’s bug bounty programme.</li>

</block>
<block title="Definition of a Cyber Security Incident"><paragraph
    title="7.2.10."


><![CDATA[<p>A <strong>cyber security incident</strong> is any event that jeopardises or may jeopardise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an information system or the information a system processes, stores, or communicates.&nbsp; This includes a violation or potential violation of security policies, security procedures, acceptable use policies or any relevant regulation or legislation.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Background"><paragraph
    title="7.2.11."


><![CDATA[<p>The detection,&nbsp;triaging, recording, management and response to an incident depends primarily on effective prevention and detection mechanisms and a robust response plan.&nbsp; Effective detection and response mechanisms also provide an important record of events and assist in preventing repeat events, improving defences and streamlining response measures.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="7.2.12."


><![CDATA[<p>A key part of the detection and response is incident reporting, including internal security system reports as well as any essential external reporting.&nbsp; It is essential that response is timely and methodical in order to minimise the effects of the incident.&nbsp; In all cases it is vital that steps are taken to quickly contain the incident, minimise damage and implement measures to prevent or contain any reoccurrence.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="7.2.13."


><![CDATA[<p>Not&nbsp;every cybersecurity event is serious enough to warrant detailed investigation and reporting, for example a single multi-factor authentication challenge failure from an employee on premises.&nbsp; Multiple multi-factor challenge failures, however, may indicate a malicious access attempt.&nbsp; Thresholds should be established which will trigger an incident response.&nbsp; In all cases, once an incident has been determined, it should be recorded to support analysis and reporting.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="7.2.14."


><![CDATA[<p>It&nbsp;is also important to categorise incidents in order to better manage allocation of resources to the containment and remediation of the incident.&nbsp; A three-tier categorisation is suggested:</p>
<ol>
<li class="NormS7C2"><strong>Critical</strong>: Incident affecting critical systems or information with potential to impact operations, revenue, customers or information disclosed in data breach.<br>For example, distributed denial of service attack, unauthorised access to system, multi-system ransomware.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Serious</strong>: Incident affecting noncritical systems or information, impact on operations, revenue, customers or information disclosed in data breach.<br>For example, execution of malware on a single system, potentially compromised credentials.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Low</strong>: Possible incident affecting noncritical systems.&nbsp; Incidents or employee investigations that are not time sensitive.&nbsp; <br>For example, blocked phishing attempts.</li>
</ol>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="7.2.15."


><![CDATA[<p>Incidents where the scope or cause of activity has not yet been determined should be categorised as serious or critical and actioned accordingly.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="7.2.16."


><![CDATA[<p>Fa<span>ctors that assist in determining the severity of an incident include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Whether the incident affects a single agency or multiple agencies;</li>
<li><!--[endif]-->Functional impact of the incident (availability);</li>
<li><!--[endif]-->Information impact of the incident (confidentiality, integrity);</li>
<li><!--[endif]-->Recoverability from the incident;</li>

 </subsection>
<subsection title="Context"> <block title="Scope"><paragraph
    title="10.1.2."


><![CDATA[<p>This section covers information relating to cable distribution systems used in facilities within New Zealand. When designing cable management systems, <a title="Cable Labelling and Registration" href="http://nzism.gcsb.govt.nz/ism-document#Section-13749">Section 10.5 - Cable Labelling and Registration</a> and <a title="Cable Patching" href="http://nzism.gcsb.govt.nz/ism-document#Section-13786">Section 10.6 - Cable Patching</a> of this chapter also apply.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Applicability of controls within this section"><paragraph
    title="10.1.3."


><![CDATA[<p>The controls within this section are applicable only to communications infrastructure located within facilities in New Zealand. For deployable platforms or facilities outside of New Zealand Emanation Security Threat Assessments (Section 10.7) of this chapter of this manual MUST be consulted.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Common implementation scenarios"><paragraph
    title="10.1.4."


><![CDATA[<p>This section provides common requirements for non-shared facilities. Specific requirements for facilities shared between agencies and facilities shared with non-government entities can be found in subsequent sections of this chapter.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Red/Black Concept and Cable Separation"><paragraph
    title="10.1.5."


><![CDATA[<p>The <strong>RED/BLACK</strong> concept is the separation of electrical and electronic circuits, devices, equipment cables, connectors, components and systems that transmit store or process national security information from non-national security information. The <strong>RED/BLACK</strong> concept is sometimes described as <strong>RED/BLACK</strong> architecture or <strong>RED/BLACK</strong> engineering.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="10.1.6."


><![CDATA[<p>The <strong>RED/BLACK</strong> concept should not be confused with the generic description HIGH/LOW or HIGH SIDE/LOW SIDE.  In this context, HIGH refers to systems <strong>classified</strong> CONFIDENTIAL and above and LOW refers to systems <strong>classified</strong> RESTRICTED and below.  While these concepts are similar and often used interchangeably, it is important to recognise that information does not usually change classification. The signal or transmission, however, may transit both <strong>RED</strong> and <strong>BLACK</strong> systems in order to reach its intended destination. It is important to note that systems carrying a particular classification may also carry information at <strong>ALL </strong>lower classifications <strong>BUT NOT</strong> any higher classifications.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="10.1.7."


><![CDATA[<p>An example is the use of radio transmissions or Wi-Fi where the information may hold a HIGH classification and originate in <strong>RED</strong> equipment but once transmission occurs the <strong>signal</strong> is <strong>BLACK</strong> as radio and Wi-Fi signals can be detected by anyone within range.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="10.1.8."


><![CDATA[<p>This also leads to the situation where some equipment may have both <strong>RED</strong> and <strong>BLACK</strong> elements.  Examples include Wi-Fi Access Points and encryption devices.  <strong>RED</strong> Information in a <strong>BLACK</strong> environment is invariably protected by encryption and a variety of technical countermeasures.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="10.1.9."


><![CDATA[<p>All cables with metal conductors (the signal carrier, the grounding element, the strengthening member or an armoured outer covering) can act as fortuitous signal conductors allowing signals to escape or to cross-contaminate other cables and signals.  This provides a path for the exploitation of signals, data and information.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="10.1.10."


><![CDATA[<p>A fundamental control is the separation of cables and related equipment with sufficient distance between them to prevent cross-contamination.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Cable trays"><paragraph
    title="10.1.11."


><![CDATA[<p class="NormS10C1b">Where copper or a combination of copper and fibre cables are used, cable trays will provide separation, assist cable management and enhance cable protection.&nbsp; While preferable to separate RED cables of different&nbsp;systems for cable management purposes, the most important element is to maintain RED/BLACK separation.&nbsp;</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="10.1.12."


><![CDATA[<p>It is preferable that cable trays contain dividers.&nbsp; Some cable trays provide only a single receptacle for cables (no dividers).&nbsp;If dividers are not available, multi-core fibre cables should be used.&nbsp; Cables of similar classifications should be bundled.&nbsp; A typical cable tray layout with dividers is depicted below:</p>

</block>
<block title="Catenary"><paragraph
    title="10.1.13."


><![CDATA[<p class="NormS10C1b">The use of catenary (wire, rope, nylon cord or similar cable support mechanisms) is becoming more widespread in place of cable trays.  Care MUST be taken to maintain <strong>RED/BLACK</strong> separation if this method of cable support is used.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Earthing"><paragraph
    title="10.1.14."


><![CDATA[<p class="NormS10C1b">It is important that any metal trays or metal catenary are earthed for both safety and to avoid creating any fortuitous conductors.  All earthing points MUST be equipotentially bonded.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Fibre optic cabling"><paragraph
    title="10.1.15."


><![CDATA[<p>Fibre optic cabling does not produce, and is not influenced by, electromagnetic emanations; as such it offers the highest degree of protection from electromagnetic emanation effects.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="10.1.16."


><![CDATA[<p>Many more fibres can be run per cable diameter than wired cables thereby reducing cable infrastructure costs. Fibre Optic cable is usually constructed with a glass core, cladding on the core and a further, colour coded coating. Multiple cores can be bundled into a single cable and multiple cables can be bundled into a high capacity cable. This is illustrated in Figures 1 below. Cables also have a central strength member of mylar or some similar high strength, non-conductive material</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="10.1.17."


><![CDATA[<p>Fibre cable is considered the best method to future proof against unforeseen threats.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph

<block title="Ribbon Fibre Optic Cable"><paragraph
    title="10.1.19."


><![CDATA[<p class="NormS10C1b">In the context of this discussion, traditional and ribbon fibre optic cables are subject to identical controls, restrictions in installation and use and any operational caveats.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="10.1.20."


><![CDATA[<p>Unlike traditional beam optical cable, ribbon fibre optic cable is arranged into a strip.&nbsp; Because the ribbon contains only coated optical fibres, this type of cable takes up much less space and is generally lighter (weight) than individually buffered optical fibres.&nbsp; As a result, ribbon cables are denser than any other fibre cable design.&nbsp; They are ideal for applications where space is limited, such as in an existing conduit that has very little room left for an additional cable.&nbsp; Ribbon fibre optic cable is a convenient solution for space and weight challenges.</p><p><img class="leftAlone" style="width: 265px; height: 254px;" title="" src="assets/Uploads/Figure-2a-Typical-Ribbon-Cable.jpg" alt="" width="499" height="499">&nbsp;<img class="leftAlone" style="width: 261px; height: 248px;" title="" src="assets/NZISM/Figure-2b-Typical-Ribbon-Cable.jpg" alt="" width="317" height="300"></p><p class="NormS10C1b">Figure 2: Typical Ribbon Cable</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="10.1.21."


><![CDATA[<p class="NormS10C1b">Ribbon cables enable the migration to high fibre count systems required to support high bandwidth applications including 10, 40 and 100Gb/s.  Ribbon cables are rarely used in long distance fibre optic trunk cable but are typically used in data centres, campus, commercial buildings and large industrial sites.  Fibre counts can range from 2 to over 1700.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="10.1.22."


><![CDATA[<p class="NormS10C1b">The cable ribbons are coated optical fibres placed side by side, encapsulated in Mylar tape, similar to a miniature version of wire ribbons used in computer wiring.  A single ribbon many contain 4, 8, 12 or 24 optical fibres with ribbons stacked up to 22 high.  At present 12-fiber ribbons are readily accessible and identifiable with ribbon identification numbers, TIA-598 compliant fibre colour coding and are available with non-flame-retardant or formulated flame-retardant outer jacket.  They are also available in several configurations including all-dielectric, armoured and aerial self-supporting cables.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="10.1.23."


><![CDATA[<p class="NormS10C1b">Because the cable profile is different to older round cable type, new cable strippers, cleavers, and fusion splicers are required for installation and maintenance.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="10.1.24."


><![CDATA[<p class="NormS10C1b">Fibre optic ribbon cable comes in two basic configurations: loose tube ribbon cable and jacket ribbon.  Loose tube cables are where fibre ribbons are stacked on top of one another inside a loose-buffered tube.  This arrangement can hold several hundred fibres in close quarters. The buffer, strength members, and cable jacket carry any strain while the fibre ribbons move freely inside the buffer tube.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="10.1.25."


><![CDATA[<p>Jacket ribbon cable is similar to a regular tight-buffered cable, but it is elongated to contain a fibre ribbon. This type of cable typically features a small amount of strength member and a ripcord to tear through the jacket.</p>

<block title="Armoured Fibre optic cabling"><paragraph
    title="10.1.27."


><![CDATA[<p>Some fibre optic cable also includes conductive metal cable strengtheners and conductive metal armoured sheaths which may be wire-wound or stainless steel mesh for external cable protection and steel wire cores as core strength members. This strengthening and armouring is conductive and specialist advice may be needed to avoid earth loops, cross-coupling, inductive coupling or the introduction of other compromising signals and currents. Fibre optic cable with metal cable strengtheners or conductive armoured sheaths is considered <em>unsuitable</em> for secure installations.</p>

<block title="Backbone"><paragraph
    title="10.1.28."


><![CDATA[<p>A backbone or core is the central cabling that connects the infrastructure (servers, databases, gateways, equipment and telecommunication rooms etc.) to local areas networks, workstations and other devices, such as MFD’s. Smaller networks may also be connected to the backbone.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="10.1.29."


><![CDATA[<p>A backbone can span a geographic area of any size including an office, a single building, multi-story buildings, campus, national and international infrastructure. In the context of the NZISM the term backbone generally refers to the central cabling within a building or a campus.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph

</block>
<block title="Power Filters"><paragraph
    title="10.1.32."


><![CDATA[<p>A power filter is a device placed between an external power source and electronic devices.  It is used in order to attenuate external transients, conducted radio frequencies (RF) or electromagnetic interference (EMI) between the AC or DC power line and the equipment.  Filters can also reduce radiated interference to assist in managing emissions or susceptibility to interference.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="10.1.33."


><![CDATA[<p>The power lines entering an electronic device can act both as an antenna and as a low impedance conduction path for signals that exist inside the device.  These signals may couple into the power line, either through inductance or capacitance, from internal circuitry, other internal wiring or from other components such as transformers, coils or adjacently routed wires.  To a lesser degree, but still problematic, the power lines can also pickup induced current signals from magnetic fields inside the enclosure.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="10.1.34."


><![CDATA[<p>The purpose of power supply filters is to smooth the power supply and provide a degree of isolation from the external power supply for connected electronic devices.  RF/EMI filters are designed to reduce line - to - ground (common mode) interference, EMI and anomalous RF.  Best practice is to solve or suppress EMI and RF emissions at source, rather than after emission.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="10.1.35."


><![CDATA[<p>There are international and national regulations on frequencies and signal levels that a device is permitted to produce in order to minimise or prevent interference with other equipment.  Practically no modern equipment, with fast digital circuits and switch-mode power supply regulators can meet electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) requirements without efficient filtering, particularly when operating in close proximity.  While most devices are designed by manufacturers to meet regulation, not all devices filter EMI or RF to levels acceptable for secure environments.  It may be necessary to use a power line filter to keep signals inside the enclosure as much as possible and keep any generated signals to less than the legal or required limits for conducted emissions.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="10.1.36."


><![CDATA[<p>Power filters have a variety of capabilities depending on their specification.  It is important the filters are selected correctly for the power supply, expected load and required attenuation capacity. It is important to note that an Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) is NOT considered an RF/EMI filter.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="10.1.37."


><![CDATA[<p>Common usage of filters is for computer systems, laboratory and testing equipment, medical devices, consumer electronics, and to protect any equipment where good quality power supply and protection of the electronic devices and data is required.  Devices can be within buildings, vehicle, ships, aircraft or portable.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="10.1.38."


><![CDATA[<p>Power filters often include EMC/ RFI filters which channel emissions to earth to prevent them from being conducted back down the supply cables.  This can be detected as an earth leakage current which may cause Residual Current Devices (RCDs) to trip.  This problem can be corrected by using the correct specification of power filter or installing low leakage current devices.  Agencies should consult the GCSB if such problems occur.</p>]]></paragraph>

    title="10.6.14."


><![CDATA[<p class="NormS10C6">Standardised rack layouts and cable management are important for engineering support, security, equipment cooling and to minimise accidental or unnecessary outages.  Many data centres will dictate a hotside (hot air out) and coldside (cold air in).  The hotside is generally the rear of equipment and the rack.  The coldside is generally the front panel of equipment and rack.  The ducting of hot/cold air is often also standardised. </p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="10.6.15."


><![CDATA[<p class="NormS10C6"> Standardising rack layout and cable management minimises problems caused by:</p><ul>
<li>Accidently not being able to locate end points of network and patch cables without tracing the cable end to end.</li>
<li>Physically impeding access to equipment.</li>
<li>Positioning of equipment and cables such that airflow (cooling) is impeded.  As the density of equipment in racks increases, cooling becomes an increasingly important factor.  Poor rack design combined with dense rack utilization can contribute to internal rack temperatures significantly higher than ambient room temperatures.</li>

<block title="Separation of Cable Runs"><paragraph
    title="10.6.19."


><![CDATA[<p>In order to maintain the integrity of <strong>RED</strong>/<strong>BLACK</strong> separation, cables for power and data should be separately bundled as power <strong>RED</strong> or <strong>BLACK</strong> and data <strong>RED</strong> or <strong>BLACK</strong>.  Cables should be run with as much distance between the bundles as can be practically managed, within the constraints of cable feeds and rack configuration.  Ideally <strong>RED</strong> and <strong>BLACK</strong> should be on opposite sides of the rack. Cables should be no longer than required to avoid overlength cables compromising separation.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Access to BLACK equipment and components by uncleared staff and contractors"><paragraph
    title="10.6.20."


><![CDATA[<p>In some instances there may be a requirement for external technical or other uncleared personnel to access <strong>BLACK</strong> equipment and components for servicing, repair or replacement.  Care must be taken to maintain the integrity of <strong>RED</strong> equipment and components.  This can be especially problematic in shared rack configurations as described above.</p><p>This requirement should be identified before installation takes place and segregation measures implemented.  Ideally physical separation of <strong>BLACK</strong> from <strong>RED</strong> is the best solution, recognising however, this may not always be possible or practical. Other solutions may include, for example, a shared rack that has two doors with the <strong>RED</strong> door locked and alarmed so that <strong>BLACK</strong> equipment can be accessed without compromising the security of <strong>RED</strong> equipment.  Discussion with the GCSB may identify other practical solutions.</p>]]></paragraph>

 </subsection>
<subsection title="Context"> <block title="Scope"><paragraph
    title="10.8.2."


><![CDATA[<p>This section includes discussion of the principles of separation and segregation as network design and network architecture characteristics.  It also discusses how IP addresses can be used to support these principles for improved security of larger or multi-classification agency systems.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Background"><paragraph
    title="10.8.3."


><![CDATA[<p>The larger the network, the more difficult it is to protect.  A large, unsegmented network presents a large attack surface with greater susceptibility to the rapid spread and dissemination of system faults, weaknesses, vulnerabilities and attacks.  In a non-segmented network, traffic and applications generally have access to the entire network. If a fault occurs or an attacker gains entry, the fault or attacker can move laterally through the network causing disruption, network outages and enabling access to critical operational or classified data.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="10.8.4."


><![CDATA[<p>A large network is also more difficult to monitor and control.  Segmenting the network limits an attacker’s ability to move through the network by preventing lateral movement between zones.  Segmentation also enhances the ability to detect, monitor, control, isolate and correct faults.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="10.8.5."


><![CDATA[<p>A fundamental construct in the management of risk in networks is that of Trust Zones and Trust Boundaries. &nbsp;A Trust Zone is a zoning construct based on levels of trust, classification, information asset value and essential information security. &nbsp;A Trust Boundary is the interface between two or more Trust Zones. Trust Zones use the principles of separation and segregation to manage sensitive information assets and ensure security policies are consistently applied to all assets in a particular Trust Zone. &nbsp;Refer also to <a title="Cloud computing" href="http://nzism.gcsb.govt.nz/ism-document#Section-17217">Section 22.1 – Cloud Computing</a> and <a title="Virtualisation" href="http://nzism.gcsb.govt.nz/ism-document#Section-17306">Section 22.2 – Virtualisation</a>.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Separation and Segregation"><paragraph
    title="10.8.6."


><![CDATA[<p>Separation and Segregation are determined by system function and the sensitivity of the data the system stores, processes and transmits.  One common example is placing systems that require a connection to the Internet into a demilitarized zone (DMZ) that is separated and segregated (isolated) from more sensitive systems. Another example is the use of compartments.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="10.8.7."


><![CDATA[<p>Separation and Segregation limits the ability of an intruder to exploit a vulnerability with the intent of elevating privileges to gain access to more sensitive systems on the internal network.  VLANs may be used to further separate systems by controlling access and providing segregation thus giving additional protection.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="10.8.8."


><![CDATA[<p>Network segmentation is an effective strategy for protecting access to key data assets, and impeding the lateral movement of system faults, threats and malicious activity.  Segregation has the following benefits:</p><ul>
<li>Enhanced performance: with fewer hosts per subnet, there is a reduced signalling and traffic overhead allowing more bandwidth for data communication.</li>
<li>Improved security: with less signalling traffic going through all network segments, it is more difficult for an attacker to analyse the addressing scheme and network structure.  Failures in one segment are less likely to propagate and more robust access control can be established and enforced.</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="10.8.9."

<li>Specialised knowledge: networks may support many devices with complex policies and rule sets.  Support staff must be properly educated and trained to ensure the network segmentation is maintained.</li>

<block title="ISO 27001 and ISO 27002 implementation recommendations for network segregation"><paragraph
    title="10.8.10."


><![CDATA[<p>These ISO Standards require the implementation of network segregation.  In particular they recommend that groups of information services, users, and information systems are segregated on networks.  Specific recommendations are summarised below:</p><ul>
<li>Divide large networks into separate network domains (segments);</li>
<li>Consider physical and logical segregation;</li>
<li>Define domain perimeters;</li>
<li>Define traffic rules between domains;</li>
<li>Use authentication, encryption, and user-level network access control technologies;</li>
<li>Consider integration of the organisation’s network and segments with those of business partners.</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="10.8.11."


><![CDATA[<p>The following structures and techniques should be considered:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Criteria-based segmentation</strong>: Pre-define rules to establish perimeters and create new segments in order to reduce unnecessary redesign and future administrative overheads. &nbsp;Examples of criteria are trust level (e.g., external public segment, staff segment, server segment, database segment, suppliers segment, etc.), organisational unit (e.g., Operations, Service Desk, Outreach, etc.), and combinations (e.g., external public access).</li>
<li><strong>Use of physical and logical segmentation:</strong> Depending upon the risk level identified in the risk assessment, it may be necessary to use physically separated infrastructures to protect the organisation’s information and assets (e.g., classified data flowing through a dedicated fibre), or you may use solutions based on logical segmentation like Virtual Private Network (VPN).</li>
<li><strong>Access rules for traffic flowing</strong>: Traffic between segments, including those of permitted external parties, should be controlled according to the need to access information. &nbsp;Gateways should be configured based on information classification and risk assessment. A specific case of access control applies to wireless networks, since they have poor perimeter definition. &nbsp;The recommendation is to treat wireless communication as an external connection until the traffic can reach a proper wired gateway before granting access to internal network segments. Refer also to <a title="Gateway Security" href="http://nzism.gcsb.govt.nz/ism-document#Chapter-16567">Chapter 19 – Gateway Security</a>.</li>

<subsection title="Network Design"><paragraph
    title="10.8.12"


><![CDATA[<p>A poorly designed network has increased support costs, reduced availability, security risks, and limited support for new applications and solutions. &nbsp;Less-than-optimal performance affects end users and access to central resources. Some of the issues that stem from a poorly designed network may include the following:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Failure domains</strong>: One of the most important reasons to implement an effective network design is to minimise the spread and extent of faults. &nbsp;When Layer 2 and Layer 3 boundaries are not clearly deﬁned, failure in one network area can have a far-reaching effect.</li>
<li><strong>Broadcast domains</strong>: Broadcasts exist in every network. &nbsp;Many applications and network operations require broadcasts to function correctly; therefore, it is not possible to eliminate them completely. &nbsp;In the same way that avoiding failure domains involves clearly deﬁning boundaries, broadcast domains should have clear boundaries and include an optimal number of devices to minimise the negative impact of broadcasts.</li>
<li><strong>MAC unicast ﬂooding</strong>: Some switches limit unicast frame forwarding to ports that are associated with the speciﬁc unicast address. &nbsp;However, when frames arrive at a destination MAC address that is not recorded in the MAC table, they are ﬂooded out of the switch ports in the same VLAN except for the port that received the frame. &nbsp;This behaviour is called unknown MAC unicast ﬂooding.</li>
<li>Because this type of ﬂooding causes excessive trafﬁc on all the switch ports, network interface cards (NIC) must contend with a larger number of frames on the wire. &nbsp;When data is propagated on a connection or network segment for which it was not intended, security can be compromised.</li>
<li><strong>Multicast trafﬁc on ports where it is not intended</strong>: IP multicast is a technique that allows IP trafﬁc to be propagated from one source to a multicast group that is identiﬁed by a single IP and MAC destination-group address pair. &nbsp;Similar to unicast ﬂooding and broadcasting, multicast frames are ﬂooded out all the switch ports. A robust design allows for the containment of multicast frames while allowing them to be functional.</li>
<li><strong>Difﬁculty in management and support</strong>: Trafﬁc ﬂows can be difficult to identify in a poorly designed network. &nbsp;This can make support, maintenance, and problem resolution time-consuming and difficult as well as creating security risks.</li>
<li><strong>Possible security vulnerabilities</strong>: A switched network that has been designed with little attention to security requirements at the access layer can compromise the integrity of the entire network.</li>
<li><strong>Criteria-based segmentation</strong>: Pre-define rules to establish perimeters and create new segments in order to reduce unnecessary redesign and future administrative overheads. &nbsp;Examples of criteria are trust level (e.g., external public segment, staff segment, server segment, database segment, suppliers segment, etc.), organisational unit (e.g., Operations, Service Desk, Outreach, etc.), and combinations (e.g., external public access).</li>

 <block title="Design Implementation"><paragraph
    title="10.8.13."


><![CDATA[<p>To assist in the implementation of separation and segregation as network design and architectural principles, the following aspects should be considered:</p><ul>
<li>Classification;</li>
<li>Security Zones;</li>
<li>IP Address Management;</li>
<li>Central Information Repository;</li>
<li>Private Use of Reserved Addresses;</li>
<li>Devices with Default IP Addresses; and</li>
<li>Connector types and cable colours.</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Classification"><paragraph
    title="10.8.14."


><![CDATA[<p>Classified systems should, by definition, be segregated.  This is particularly important where network elements have access to compartments and compartmented data.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="10.8.15."


><![CDATA[<p>Ideally compartmented elements of systems should be segregated and separated from the main network.  This may include the use of a reserved address space, monitored to detect violations or unauthorised attempts to connect to compartments or to access compartmented data.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Security Zones"><paragraph
    title="10.8.16."


><![CDATA[<p>A security zone is a group of one or more physical or virtual firewall interfaces and the network segments connected to the zone’s interfaces.  Protection for each zone is individually specified and controlled so that each zone receives the specific protections it requires according to classification, endorsement, compartment and sensitivity of data.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="IP Address Management"><paragraph
    title="10.8.17."


><![CDATA[<p>The fundamental goal of an IP addressing scheme is to ensure network devices are uniquely addressed.  IP Address Schemes are a fundamental part of any network’s security architecture and should support network separation and segregation.  There are a number of techniques to assist in separating and segregating network elements. It is also useful to consider how to segregate and control network traffic through:</p><ul>
<li>Defined network perimeters and boundaries; and</li>
<li>Defined network traffic rules.</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="10.8.18."


><![CDATA[<p>A well-structured IP addressing scheme promotes the ability to quickly identify node properties from an IP address which assist in network management and fault finding and rectification.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Address Block Allocation"><paragraph
    title="10.8.19."


><![CDATA[<p>There are two main difficulties when assigning address blocks for types of devices.  First is that over time there is insufficient provision for additional devices and network growth.  When the allocated address block is exhausted, the addressing scheme is compromised (broken). The second is that you have a small number of devices in an address block, but are running out of addresses in other parts of the network.  If you “borrow” from a pre-assigned address range, the addressing scheme is also compromised.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="10.8.20."


><![CDATA[<p>Internal IP address ranges are defined by the IETF. &nbsp;Commonly known as RFC 1918 addresses, the most recent RFC is 6761. &nbsp;These RFC’s define private IP address ranges which cannot be used for external (Internet) IP addressing. &nbsp;Three address ranges (blocks) are defined:</p>
<table class="table-main">

><![CDATA[<p>Private addressing is a means of distinguishing networks, assisting in separation and segregation.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Private use of reserved addresses"><paragraph
    title="10.8.23."


><![CDATA[<p>Some IP addresses have been reserved in IETF standards.  Despite official warnings, some organisations use parts of the reserved IP address space for their internal networks where address space is exhausted or poorly designed.  This creates conflicts with devices and signalling traffic protocols which can create network faults, anomalies and network outages. This practice is strongly discouraged.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Devices which have default IP addresses"><paragraph
    title="10.8.24."


><![CDATA[<p>Some devices are supplied with default IP addresses.  If using the IETF RFC 1918 addressing protocol (e.g. 10.0.x.x) some devices may have been allocated the same (duplicate) IP address.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="10.8.25."


><![CDATA[<p>It is important to change default addresses to new addresses that conform with the addressing scheme selected for the agency.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="DHCP"><paragraph
    title="10.8.26."


><![CDATA[<p>In theory, there is only one network device that absolutely needs a true static address, the DHCP server.  In practice, it is preferable to assign address blocks to major groups of devices for control, fault isolation and security purposes.  Traditionally static devices are provided with a reserved address. These devices may include:</p><ul>
<li>DCHP Server;</li>
<li>Gateway devices;</li>
<li>Firewalls;</li>
<li>Routers; and</li>
<li>Switches.</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="10.8.27."


><![CDATA[<p>The majority of other devices can be allocated a DHCP address.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="10.8.28."


><![CDATA[<p>It is important to identify the essential device groups using a risk assessment, operational characteristics, level of security, system classification and other relevant architectural features, business requirements and operational constraints.</p>]]></paragraph>

<block title="Connector Types and Cable Colours"><paragraph
    title="10.8.29."


><![CDATA[<p>Cable management is discussed in detail earlier in this chapter. &nbsp;In particular note the discussion (<a href="http://nzism.gcsb.govt.nz/ism-document#Paragraph-13531">10.1.4</a>) of Red/Black concepts which includes separation of electrical and electronic circuits, devices, equipment cables, connectors and systems that transmit store or process national security information (Red) from non-national security information (Black)</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="10.8.30."


><![CDATA[<p>Wherever practical and possible, connectors for systems of different classifications should be distinct and be selected to avoid accidental cross-connection of systems of different classifications.  This can be achieved through the use of colour and keyed connectors where the colour and keying is different for each classification level or compartment (refer also to 10.1.30 and 10.6.6).</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Central Information Repository"><paragraph
    title="10.8.31."


><![CDATA[<p>Creating a central repository of all the information on networks, IP addresses and devices, is critical to maintaining control of the network.  The challenge with traditional tools is that there are often specific tools for each category of devices: one system to track virtual machines, one system to track wireless users, one system to track Windows servers, one system to track Linux machines, etc.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="10.8.32."


><![CDATA[<p>A single repository where all the data relevant to networks, hosts, servers, dynamic clients, and virtual environments can be tracked and synchronised is essential for larger networks.  The ability to search across all this information will enable network teams to quickly track changing network landscapes and rapidly troubleshoot issues as they arise. In addition, business data related to a network resource helps bind together the logical network construct and the reality of IT resources.</p>]]></paragraph>

><![CDATA[<p>Bluetooth is used securely and Bluetooth communications are protected.</p>]]></paragraph>
 </subsection>
<subsection title="Context"><paragraph
    title="11.1.2."


><![CDATA[<p>Bluetooth radios are commonly found in end user devices, including laptops, mobile phones, and peripherals such as speakers, headphones, keyboards, and mice. More recently Bluetooth has been integrated into medical devices and personal devices.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="11.1.3."


><![CDATA[<p>It is important to be aware of all risks associated with Bluetooth technology. The specific threats to Bluetooth communications, that the controls in this section address, relate to are:</p>
<ul>
<li>eavesdropping on the Bluetooth communications between paired devices, and&nbsp;</li>
<li>connection interception attacks that leverage the network communications channel (including during establishment) of Bluetooth devices.</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
 </subsection>
<subsection title="Background"><paragraph
    title="11.1.4."


><![CDATA[<p>The Bluetooth specification has evolved over time and is regularly updated. Version 4.0 of the specification introduced Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) which offers a different feature set than the original Bluetooth Basic Rate/Enhanced Data Rate (BR/EDR) standard. Version 4.1 and 4.2 of the specification introduced enhanced security features for Bluetooth BR/EDR and LE respectively.&nbsp;</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="11.1.5."


><![CDATA[<p>Determining the security level being provided depends on several factors, including the capabilities and Bluetooth version supported by the devices being paired together. The actual security provided between devices is a combination of:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">a. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the version of the Bluetooth specification supported by each device,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">b. &nbsp; &nbsp; the capabilities of the devices to accept user input (eg, through a keyboard, or camera) and to display output (eg, through a screen or character display), and</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">c. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;whether the devices are using Bluetooth BR/EDR or Bluetooth LE.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="11.1.6."


><![CDATA[<p>The following table summarises the security protections expected based on the pairing Bluetooth device capabilities where devices are Bluetooth BR/EDR using Secure Connections (version 4.1 or later) or Bluetooth LE using Secure Connections (version 4.2 or later) – refer to NIST SP 800-121 REV.2 Guide to Bluetooth.</p>

 </subsection>
<subsection title="Context"> <block title="Scope"><paragraph
    title="11.5.2."


><![CDATA[<p>This section covers information relating to the use of personal wearable devices, fitness devices, smart watches, devices embedding in clothing and similar wearable devices.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="11.5.3."


><![CDATA[<p>These devices can use RF in various parts of the spectrum to communicate including Wi-Fi, cellular, satellite, RFID, NFC and Bluetooth frequencies as well as providing data storage capability, audio and video recording and USB connectivity. All such wearable or mobile devices are considered to be transmitters.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="11.5.4."


><![CDATA[<p>Personal wearable devices can be equipped with a variety of capabilities including smart phone pairing, internet connectivity, cameras, speakerphones, audio and video recording and remote control. Some devices (for example Narrative and Autographer) will automatically take snapshots at intervals during the day. In some cases the snapshots are geotagged.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph

><![CDATA[<p>Merely disabling the capabilities described above is not a sufficient mitigation and is not acceptable, posing a high risk of compromise, whether intentional or accidental. The device MUST NOT have such capabilities installed if the device is to enter a secure area.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="11.5.7."


><![CDATA[<p>There is a wide variety of devices now available with upgrades and new models appearing frequently. There are many hundreds of models with a variety of custom operating systems and programmes and other applications. Some industry surveys and predications are forecasting explosive growth in the use of wearable devices, reaching over 100 million devices by 2020. Checking the capabilities and vulnerabilities of each device and subsequent security testing or validation will be an onerous task for agencies and may be infeasible.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Key Risk Areas"><paragraph
    title="11.5.8."


><![CDATA[<p>Personal wearable devices are not only about the technological aspects, the human factor is equally important. Users often forget about personal information security and their own safety, which enables social engineering attacks on the devices. The main protective measure for users is awareness, but even the <em>trust-but-verify</em> rule is not completely reliable in this situation. Accordingly, the information gathered by wearable devices should be appropriately secured to maintain privacy and personal security.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="11.5.9."


><![CDATA[<p>There are four important risk groups to be considered when managing personal wearable devices:</p>
<ol>
<li>Data leaks and breaches;</li>
<li>Network security compromises;</li>
<li>Personal information leaks; and</li>
<li>Privacy violations.</li>
</ol>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Personal Information"><paragraph
    title="11.5.10."


><![CDATA[<p>In most cases, the protection of personal information will be the responsibility of the individual. In cases where the use of devices is permitted under a medical exemption, agencies MAY be required to ensure that devices that collect and store data comply with relevant regulation and guidance, such as the Privacy Act.</p>]]></paragraph>

<paragraph
    title="11.6.4."


><![CDATA[<p>In practical use since the 1970’s, RFID is now widely used for product identification, stock control, as anti-theft in manufacturing and retail organisations, payment cards (smart ATM and paywave cards) and access control systems. They are useful tools in improving logistics, profoundly changing cost structures for business, and improving levels of safety and authenticity in a wide range of applications such as access control, passports, payment cards, vehicle immobilisers, toll roads, pharmaceuticals tracking, management of high value items and weapons control. RFID tags are now produced in a wide variety of types and sizes, from the size of a grain of rice or printed on paper to much larger devices incorporating a battery or other power supply.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="11.6.5."


><![CDATA[<p>Unlike bar coding systems, RFID devices can communicate without requiring line of sight and over distances ranging from a few centimetres to kilometres. They can be equipped with sensors to collect data on temperature changes, sudden shocks, humidity or other factors affecting product safety and quality.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="11.6.6."


><![CDATA[<p>RFID devices typically use radio signals to transmit identifying information such as product or serial numbers, manufacture date, origin and batch number. This identifying information is invariably in the form of an Electronic Product Code (EPC) following the standards and conventions published by GS1. GS1 is a global group that also develops standards for other identifiers such as barcodes. The GS1 standards and conventions are now incorporated into ISO standards, see references table&nbsp;at <a href="http://nzism.gcsb.govt.nz/ism-document#Paragraph-14247">11.6.57</a>.</p>]]></paragraph>

<block title="Basic Formats"><paragraph
    title="11.6.7."


><![CDATA[<p>The basic format of an Electronic Product Code (EPC) is illustrated below:</p>

<paragraph
    title="11.6.8."


><![CDATA[<p>RFID devices are often referred to as “tags”. Passive tags are unpowered and harvest power from the RFID reader. Active tags incorporate a power supply, usually a battery. Tags are produced in Classes 0 to 5 and are now generally produced to Generation 2 specifications. The EPCGen2 standard for Class 1 tags focuses on reliability and efficiency but supports only very basic security. Features of the Gen 2 specification include:</p><ul>
<li><strong>a 96 bit EPC number</strong> with read/write capability and can be designated used for other data ;</li>
<li><strong>a 32/64 bit tag identifier</strong> (TID) – identifies the manufacturer of the tag, also with read/write capabilities; </li>
<li><strong>32 bit kill password</strong> to permanently disable the tag; </li>
<li><strong>32 bit access password</strong> to lock the read/write characteristics of the tag and also set the tag for disabling ;</li>
<li><strong>User memory</strong> – dependant on the manufacturer and can be as little as 0 bits to 2048 bits. Larger user memory is in development.</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="11.6.9."


><![CDATA[<p>The distance from which a tag can be read is termed the read range. A read range will depend on a number of factors, including the radio frequency used for reader/tag/reader communication, the size and orientation of the antennae, the power output of the reader, and whether the tags have a battery or other power supply. Battery-powered tags typically have a read range of 100 meters (approximately 300 feet) although this can extend to kilometres under favourable conditions. It is possible that powered RFID tags, typically used on cargo containers, railway wagons, vehicles and other large assets, could be read from a satellite if there is little background “noise” and the broadcast signal is sufficiently powerful.</p>]]></paragraph>

<block title="Operating Frequencies"><paragraph
    title="11.6.11."


><![CDATA[<p>RFID operates in several parts of the Radio Spectrum. Not all frequencies are authorised for use in all countries and will depend on the radio spectrum allocation authority in each country. It is important to note, however, that some RFID tags designed to operate at frequencies not used in the importing country may be attached to imported goods. This can represent a risk from scanning at frequencies not authorised or normally monitored in the importing country.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="11.6.12."

<block title="Smart Cards"><paragraph
    title="11.6.14."


><![CDATA[<p>Smart cards typically comprise an embedded integrated circuit incorporating a microchip with internal memory, a read-only CSN (Card Serial Number) or a UID (User Identification). The card connects to a reader with direct physical contact or a contactless radio frequency (RFID) interface. With an embedded microchip, smart cards can store large amounts of data, carry out on-card functions (such as encryption and authentication) and interact intelligently with a smart card reader. Smart card technology can be found in a variety of form factors, including plastic cards, key fobs, watches, subscriber identification modules used in mobile phones, and USB-based tokens. Smart cards are widely used in payment card (debit and credit cards and electronic wallets) and access control systems.</p>]]></paragraph>

><![CDATA[<p>In common with other RFID devices, smart cards incorporate an antenna embedded in the body of the card (or key fob, watch or token). When the card is brought within range of the reader, the chip in the card is powered on. Once powered on, an RF communication protocol is initiated and communication established between the card and the reader for data transfer.</p>]]></paragraph>

<subsection title="Threats and Vulnerabilities"><paragraph
    title="11.6.18"


><![CDATA[<p>Some important characteristics of RFID, inherent in the design and properties of the technology are:</p><ul>
<li>RFID tags are powered by the field emitted by an RFID reader, so whenever a tag is placed in a reader field it is activated and available. In general terms, class 0 and class 1 tags cannot be powered off, only permanently deactivated;</li>
<li>RFID tags automatically respond to reader interactions without explicit control of the tag owner, so RFID tags can be operated without their owner’s consent;</li>
<li>It is trivial to establish a communication with an RFID tag and there is no visual confirmation of a tag/reader interaction (i.e., no physical connection or manual operation is required), so it is possible to interact with an RFID tag without being detected.</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="11.6.19"


><![CDATA[<p>Specific threats and vulnerabilities in the use of RFID technologies include:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Legitimate data-mining</strong>: This risk predates the use of RFID technology, but the volume of data provided by RFID tags, loyalty cards, Near Field Communication (NFC) for bank cards and for electronic wallets increases the risk. Some data collection methods keep to ethical use of data-mining techniques to discover the characteristics and habits of an individual or an organisation. This can pose a business intelligence risk. At times, however, this may challenge the bounds of privacy and data ownership. For example, customer loyalty card data used to discover medical information about an individual or RFID tags to track shipments or deliveries to an organisation by a competitor.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Eavesdropping and Data theft</strong>: This risk is similar to the data-mining risk but employs unethical and possibly illegal methods of data collection or obtaining data for nefarious or malicious purposes. RFID tags are designed to broadcast information and data theft by easily concealable RFID scanners is technically trivial. Data theft can pose a risk to business processes.</li>
<li><strong>Skimming</strong>: Occurs when an unauthorised reader gains access to data stored on a token. This type of attack is particularly dangerous where contactless access or payment cards are used.</li>
<li><strong>Relay Attacks</strong>: Relay attacks use eavesdropping to intercept legitimate tag/reader transmissions and relay these to a device at some distance from the legitimate tag. The device can then behave as the genuine tag. Again this type of attack is particularly dangerous where contactless access or payment cards are used.</li>
<li><strong>Insert Attacks</strong>: Insert attacks insert system commands where normal data is expected and relies on a lack of data validation. It is possible that a tag can have legitimate data replaced by a malicious command.</li>
<li><strong>Tag Cloning</strong>: Clones replicate the functionality of legitimate tags and can be used to access controlled areas, abuse private data, or make an unauthorised electronic transaction. Tag authentication using a challenge-response protocol is a defence against cloning as the information that attackers can obtain through the air interface (such as by eavesdropping) is insufficient to provide a legitimate response. The design of the tag can also incorporate measures at the circuit manufacturing stage to protect tags from duplication by reverse engineering.</li>
<li><strong>Data corruption</strong>: Most RFID tags are rewritable by design. This feature may be locked (turning the tag into a write-once, read-many device) or left active, depending on application and security sensitivity. For example, in libraries, the RFID tags are frequently left unlocked for the convenience of librarians in reusing the tags on different books or to track check-ins and check-outs. If tags are not protected, it creates an opportunity for malicious users to overwrite data, typically in the theft of high-value goods by marking them as low-value items or in the case of weapons monitoring, changing the weapon identification.</li>
<li><strong>Shipment or People tracking</strong>: While RFID tags are designed to assist in stock control and supply chain management, unauthorised tracking of shipments or of people is undesirable and may even be dangerous. It is possible to follow individuals carrying tags using several techniques, including placing fake readers at building access points, deploying unauthorised readers near legitimate readers and creating relay points along expected routes.</li>
<li><strong>Tag Blocking</strong>: This is a form of denial of service by introducing a blocker tag which is designed to simulate all possible tags in an allocated range. This causes readers to continually perform multiple reads on non-existent and non-responsive tags. Blocker tags are sometimes used where privacy or confidentiality are required.</li>
<li><strong>Denial of Service (DOS)</strong>: Also known as flooding attacks where a signal is flooded with more data than it is designed to handle. Similar in many respects to RF Jamming.</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
 <block title="Attack Vectors"><paragraph
    title="11.6.20."


><![CDATA[<p>Attack vectors for RFID devices include:</p><ul>
<li>interception of legitimate transmissions;</li>
<li>interception of authorised reader data by an unauthorised device;</li>
<li>unauthorised access to tags and readers;</li>
<li>rogue/cloned tags;</li>
<li>rogue and unauthorised RFID readers; </li>
<li>side-channel attacks (timing measurements, electromagnetic radiations etc.); </li>
<li>attacks on back-end systems;</li>
<li>jamming of legitimate signals.</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="11.6.21."


><![CDATA[<p>Because RFID devices incorporate antennas, there is a possibility of radiation hazards from high –powered devices, particularly active tags and readers. It is important to note however that these cases are rare, occur in high powered devices only and that the vast majority of RFID devices do not pose radiation hazards. Related hazards include electromagnetic radiation hazards to personnel (HERP), fuel (HERF) and ordnance (HERO).</p>]]></paragraph>

<subsection title="Good Practices and Countermeasures"><paragraph
    title="11.6.24"


><![CDATA[<p>Good practice for ensuring the security and privacy of RFID systems includes:</p><ul>
<li>a risk assessment to determine the nature and extent of risk and threat in the proposed use of RFID;</li>
<li>strong security architecture to protect RFID databases and communication systems;</li>
<li>authentication of approved users of RFID systems;</li>
<li>encryption of radio signals when feasible;</li>
<li>temporarily or permanently disabling tags when not required;</li>
<li>shielding RFID tags and tag reading areas to prevent unauthorised access or modification;</li>
<li>incident management, audit procedures, logging and time stamping to help detect and manage security breaches; and</li>
<li>tag disposal and recycling procedures that permanently disable or destroy sensitive data.</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
 <block title="Authentication"><paragraph
    title="11.6.25."


><![CDATA[<p>By design and usage, RFID technologies are item, product or shipment identification <strong>but</strong> not authentication technologies. Authentication of a reader or tag requires a common secret (key) shared when establishing communication, and before data is exchanged. Currently, only RFID tags with microprocessors have sufficient computation resources to use authentication techniques. These can be found in such applications as e-passports, or payment or ticketing applications (public transport, for example).</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="11.6.26."


><![CDATA[<p>With a challenge/response authentication mechanism the reader issues an enquiry to the tag which results in a response. The secret tag information is computed information from internal cryptographic algorithms by both the tag and reader and the results are sent. Correct responses are required for a successful information exchange. The system is essentially the same as encrypting data over a standard radio link.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="11.6.27."


><![CDATA[<p>The ISO/JTC1/SC31 committee is in the process of establishing new standards to support the use of simple RFID authentication and encryption protocols.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code (HMAC)"><paragraph
    title="11.6.28."


><![CDATA[<p>HMAC is a protocol where both an RFID reader and RFID tag share a common secret key that can be used in combination with a hash algorithm to provide one-way or mutual authentication between tag and reader. When HMAC is applied to messages, it also assures the integrity of data in the messages.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="11.6.29."


><![CDATA[<p>HMAC is not specified in any RFID standard, but the capability is generally available in vendor products. HMAC is often used where the risk of eavesdropping is high and passwords alone are considered to offer an inadequate authentication mechanism. This will be determined by the risk assessment. HMAC is also used where applications require evidence of a tag’s authenticity.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Digital Signatures"><paragraph
    title="11.6.30."


><![CDATA[<p>Digital signatures are compatible with existing RFID tag standards. In authenticated RFID systems, tags can receive, store, and transmit digital signatures with existing read and write commands because the complexity is managed by readers or back-end systems. However, the use of digital signatures to support authentication of readers to tags would require tags to support relatively complex cryptographic functions, beyond the capacity of common tag designs.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="11.6.31."

    tags="Evaluated Products"


><![CDATA[<p>In addition, digital signatures that are not generated by the tag itself are subject to replay attacks. An adversary could query a tag to obtain its evidence of authenticity (i.e., the digital signature created by a previous reader) and then replicate that data on a cloned tag. Consequently, password or symmetric key authentication systems likely will support tag access control, as opposed to tag authenticity verification, for the immediate future.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Encryption"><paragraph
    title="11.6.32."


><![CDATA[<p>Data stored in the memory of an RFID tag is intended to be freely shared with the various tag users (manufacturers, stock controllers, shipping agents, etc.). Only an RFID reader is required to access the data which raises the question of data security. Memory and computational power of an RFID tag is limited, but data elements can be password-protected or reserved for nominated usage. Several levels of authorisation (read-only, read and write, delete, etc.) can be determined. It is also advisable to encrypt the data entered onto the tag, the encryption/decryption taking place at the RFID reader or back-end system.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Cover-Coding"><paragraph
    title="11.6.33."


><![CDATA[<p>Cover-coding is a method of hiding information from eavesdroppers. In the EPCglobal Class-1 Generation-2 standard, cover-coding is used to obscure passwords and information written to a tag using the write command. Some proprietary technologies also support similar features. Cover-coding is an example of minimalist cryptography because it operates within the challenging power and memory constraints of passive RFID tags.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="11.6.34."


><![CDATA[<p>Cover-coding is a useful mitigation where eavesdropping is a risk, but adversaries are expected to be at a greater distance from the tags than readers. Cover-coding helps prevent the execution of unauthorised commands that could disable a tag or modify the tag’s data. Cover-coding mitigates business process, business intelligence, and privacy risks.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Rolling Code"><paragraph
    title="11.6.35."


><![CDATA[<p>A rolling code approach is a scheme where the identifier given by the RFID tag changes after each read action. It requires the RFID reader and RFID tag to use identical algorithms. If multiple readers are used, they must be linked so that tracking of code changes can be monitored. This scheme reduces the usefulness of any responses that may be observed unless the pattern of change can be detected or deduced.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
</subsection>
<subsection title="Other Defensive Measures"><paragraph
    title="11.6.36"


><![CDATA[<p><span>Other defensive measures, sometimes described as palliative techniques, include shielding, blocker tags, tag “kill” commands, tamper resistance and temporary deactivation. It is important to note these techniques do not use encryption.</span></p>]]></paragraph>
 <block title="Shielding"><paragraph
    title="11.6.37."


><![CDATA[<p>RF shielding is designed to limit the propagation of RF signals outside of the shielded area. Shielding helps to prevent unauthorised reading, access to or modification of the RFID tag data or interfering with RFID readers. Shielding can be applied to small, individual items, such as passports and credit cards or to large elements such as shipping containers.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="11.6.38."


><![CDATA[<p>Shielding is also important where interference is present or detected. This may be caused by environmental conditions, such as operating in a port area, or by deliberate attempts to access readers or tags.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="11.6.39."


><![CDATA[<p>Engineering assessments will determine the requirement for shielding from adverse environmental conditions and the risk assessment will determine the likelihood and threat from unauthorised and deliberate attempts to access readers, tags and data.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="11.6.40."


><![CDATA[<p>RFID blocking wallets and<strong> RFID card sleeves</strong> are available to block RFID frequencies. These are typically used for credit and other payment, access and transit cards and e-passports, as a countermeasure for skimming attacks or unauthorised tracking.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Blocker Tags"><paragraph
    title="11.6.41."


><![CDATA[<p>A special tag, called a “blocker” tag, blocks an RFID reader by simultaneously answering with 0 and 1 to every reader’s request during the identification protocol. The reader is then incapable of distinguishing individual tags. The blocker tag may block a reader universally or within ranges.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="11.6.42."


><![CDATA[<p>This furnishes privacy by shielding consumers from the unwanted scanning of RFID tags that they may carry or wear. It also protects against unauthorised readers and eavesdroppers. The blocker tag is an alternative to more simple solutions such as the kill command, shielding and active jamming. It is important to note that active jamming may be illegal (<a href="http://nzism.gcsb.govt.nz/ism-document#Paragraph-14239">see 11.6.53</a>).</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="11.6.43."


><![CDATA[<p>Blocker tags can also implement one or more privacy policies and multiple blocker tags may cover multiple zones.  The blocker tag has a very low-cost of implementation and standard tags need no modification and little support for password-protected bit flipping.  A threat is that blocker tags can be used to mount DoS attacks in which a malicious blocker tag universally blocks readers.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Tag “Kill” Command "><paragraph
    title="11.6.44."


><![CDATA[<p>The “kill” command is a password-protected command specified in the EPC Gen-1 and EPC Gen-2 standards intended to make a tag non-operational. A typical application is anti-theft where the kill command is activated at a point-of-sale terminal, after goods have been paid for. Kill commands can be password protected.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="11.6.45."


><![CDATA[<p>Kill commands function by fusing a ROM component or antenna connection by applying a large amount of power to the tag at the point of sale reader/terminal. It is important to note that the antenna deactivation method does not completely kill the tag but rather disable its RF interface. Once in the disabled state, the tag still retains data and can still function.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="11.6.46."


><![CDATA[<p>The kill feature can represent a threat to an RFID system if the password is compromised. This risk is particularly apparent where the same password is used for multiple tags. If a weak (e.g., short or easily guessed) password is assigned to the kill command, tags can be disabled at will. Also important is the longer a tag uses the same password, the more likely it is that the password will be compromised.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="11.6.47."


><![CDATA[<p>Data stored on the tag is still present in the tag’s memory after it is disabled (although it can no longer be accessed wirelessly), and, therefore, still may be accessible with physical access to the tag.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Tamper Resistance"><paragraph
    title="11.6.48."


><![CDATA[<p>Some RFID tags are designed with tamper resistant or tamper-evident features to help prevent unauthorised alteration of removal of tags from the objects to which they are attached. A simple type of tamper resistance is the use of a frangible, or easily broken, antenna. If this tag is removed, the connection with the antenna is severed, rendering the tag inoperable. Other, more complex types of RFID systems monitor the integrity of objects associated with the tags to ensure that the objects have not been compromised, altered, or subjected to extreme conditions.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="11.6.49."


><![CDATA[<p>Simple forms of tamper resistance may leave data intact and subject to the same threats described above. In addition it is possible to circumvent tamper resistance mechanisms by repairing a frangible antenna. It is important to note that tamper-resistance and tamper-evidence technologies do not prevent the theft or destruction of the tag or its associated items.</p>]]></paragraph>
</block>
<block title="Temporary Deactivation"><paragraph
    title="11.6.50."


><![CDATA[<p>Some tags allow the RF interface to be temporarily deactivated.  Methods vary amongst manufacturers with some methods requiring physical intervention.  Typically tags would be activated inside a designated area and deactivated when shipped, preventing eavesdropping or other unauthorised transactions during shipment.  When the tags arrive at their destination, they can be reactivated, for example for inventory management.  Conversely, tags can be used for tracking during shipment and may be deactivated on delivery.</p>]]></paragraph>

    tags="Communications systems,Governance,RF Devices,RFID,Risk Assessment"


><![CDATA[<p>As with many technologies, adoption of RFID has the potential to introduce a wide range of risks in addition to the risks that already exist for agency systems. This may include privacy risks, depending on the use, information held and implementation of the RFID system. A risk assessment is an essential tool in determining and assessing the range and extent of risk and threat in the use of RFID devices.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="11.6.59.R.02."

    tags="Communications systems,Governance,RF Devices,RFID,Risk Assessment"


><![CDATA[<p>Risks to RFID system vary according to the technology used, system engineering, the systems architecture, application, context and deployment scenario. A holistic approach to risk at each stage of the system life cycle and each for system component is essential if a robust security strategy is to be developed.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="11.6.59.R.03."

    tags="Communications systems,Governance,RF Devices,RFID,Risk Assessment"


><![CDATA[<p>The identification of classes of tags is fundamental to managing the risks of RFID devices in secure spaces. Classes 0 and 1 pose little risk. Other classes of tag (2 to 5), however, have limited data storage capability and active tags include transmitter functionality which introduces higher levels of risk. RFID readers are, by definition, transmitters and are not permitted in secure spaces.</p>]]></paragraph>

    tags="Communications systems,Governance,RF Devices,RFID"


><![CDATA[<p>The foundation of strong security architecture in RFID follows three important principles:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Controlled access to the data</strong> – only authorised entities (people, systems, devices) can read and write information to and from the RFID tags (EPC number, tag identifier, kill password, access password and user memory) and RFID databases;</li>
<li><strong>Control over access to the system</strong> – only authorised entities can configure or add devices to the system, and all devices on the system are authentic and trustworthy;</li>
<li><strong>Confidence and trust</strong> – back-end systems are designed and implemented in accordance with the current version of the NZISM.</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="11.6.60.R.02."

    tags="Communications systems,Technical,RF Devices,RFID"


><![CDATA[<p>Sensitive data should be held in a secure RFID Enterprise Subsystem and retrieved using the tag’s unique identifier with only an identifier stored on the tag itself. The Enterprise RFID subsystem should be established as a separate domain where data can be more adequately protected. This structure makes it more difficult for adversaries to obtain information from the tag through scanning or eavesdropping. Data encryption and access control is often more cost-effectively performed in the enterprise subsystem than in the RF subsystem.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="11.6.60.R.03."

    tags="Communications systems,Technical,RF Devices,RFID"


><![CDATA[<p>Some RFID systems may cover several organisations, for example in supply chains. In such cases, multiple organisations may require access to databases that contain tag identifiers and passwords. The security architecture should incorporate strong security controls including the authentication of external entities, incident management, audit logging and other essential security controls.</p>]]></paragraph>

The RFID usage policy should also address privacy issues associated with the tag identifier formats and the potential disclosure of information based solely on the tag identifier format selected. Agencies MAY be required to ensure that devices that collect and store data comply with relevant regulation and guidance, such as the Privacy Act.

><![CDATA[<p>If an adversary reads an identifier that is encoded with a published format, such as in the EPC standard, an adversary may be able to obtain useful information such as the manufacturer or issuer of the item, as well as the type of item. Because RFID tags hold limited information and identifier formats are published in standards, it may be important to use identifier formats that do not reveal any information about tagged items or the agency using the RFID system. This will be determined in the risk assessment. Encoding schemes to limit information revealed from unauthorised scanning may include serially or randomly assigning identifiers.</p>]]></paragraph>

At best these tags can cater for PIN-style or password-based protection. Data can, however, be encrypted before it is stored on a tag. In these designs, encryption is undertaken by the RFID subsystem or the RFID reader. This is an effective means of protecting the data on a tag.

HMAC is not specified in any RFID standard, but the capability is generally available in vendor products. HMAC is often used where the risk of eavesdropping is high and passwords alone are considered to offer an inadequate authentication mechanism. This will be determined by the risk assessment.

<block title="Background"><paragraph
    title="11.7.4."


><![CDATA[<p>Contactless access control systems based on RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) has largely replaced earlier technologies such as magnetic swipe cards in almost all security-critical applications. Two generations of RFID access cards exist:</p><ul>
<li>an earlier generation of cards, which use only basic proprietary security mechanisms; and </li>
<li>a more recent generation that incorporates advances in CMOS and smart card technology to implement cryptography and other protective measures.</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="11.7.5."


><![CDATA[<p>Older access control systems often incorporated a magnetic strip and were easily cloned. More recent systems support the use of PINs in addition to RFID. Unfortunately PINs are also sometimes stored on the cards, often unencrypted and unprotected, and thus facilitating attacks on both the card and the PIN.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="11.7.6."


><![CDATA[<p>Access control systems typically comprise four components:</p><ul>
<li>A reader that programmes the access cards for particular employees and their permitted access to parts of the site, building to secure areas.</li>
<li>A transceiver at each control point to communicate with cards.</li>
<li>A controller to control the locks of access points (doors).</li>
<li>The backend system that hosts all permissions and authorised data and interfaces with the reader, transceiver and controllers.</li>
</ul>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="11.7.7."


><![CDATA[<p>Traditionally access control systems were hosted by stand-alone equipment. Modern access control system may be hosted on standard computer equipment and hosted in the organisation’s datacentre. It is possible that a system intrusion can target access control systems, making the switches, gates and locks remotely accessible.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph

<block title="Smart Cards"><paragraph
    title="11.7.13."


><![CDATA[<p>Smart cards typically incorporate an embedded integrated circuit typically incorporating a microchip with internal memory, a read-only CSN (Card Serial Number) or a UID (User Identification). The card connects to a reader with direct physical contact or a contactless radio frequency (RFID) interface. With an embedded microchip, smart cards can store large amounts of data, carry out on-card functions (such as encryption and authentication) and interact intelligently with a smart card reader. Smart card technology can be found in a variety of form factors, including plastic cards, key fobs, watches, subscriber identification modules used in mobile phones, and USB-based tokens. Smart cards are widely used in payment card (debit and credit cards and electronic wallets) and access control systems.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="11.7.14."


><![CDATA[<p>In common with other RFID devices, smart cards incorporate an antenna embedded in the body of the card (or key fob, watch or token). When the card is brought within range of the reader, the chip in the card is powered on. Once powered on, an RF communication protocol is initiated and communication established between the card and the reader for data transfer.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph

<block title="Near Field Communication (NFC)"><paragraph
    title="11.7.16."


><![CDATA[<p>NFC is an RFID technology that enables two electronic devices to establish communication by bringing them within 4 cm of each other. As with other "proximity" technologies, NFC employs electromagnetic induction between two loop antennae when NFC devices exchange information. NFC operates in the globally available unlicensed radio frequency band of 13.56 MHz conforming to the ISO/IEC 18000-3 standard. In access control applications these devices are sometimes known as “prox cards”.</p>]]></paragraph>

<paragraph
    title="11.7.18."


><![CDATA[<p>Relay attacks rely on rogue readers to activate the tag even when not in proximity to a legitimate reader. The card holder will be unaware that such an attack is underway. An effective defence is to incorporate distance-to-reader verification although few RFID systems incorporate this mechanism.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="11.7.19."


><![CDATA[<p>Signals between cards and a legitimate reader can be intercepted at distances of up to a metre. Greater distances are possible with higher powered equipment, special antennae and in low interference environments. The signals and data, including card credentials, are captured off-line and used to clone access cards. Again the card holder will be unaware that such an attack is underway.</p>]]></paragraph>

<block title="Secure Access Module"><paragraph
    title="11.7.23."


><![CDATA[<p>A Secure Access Module (or Secure Application Module - SAM) is used to enhance the security and cryptographic performance of devices. SAMs are commonly found in devices needing to perform secure transactions, such as payment terminals. It can be used for cryptographic computation and secure authentication against smart cards or contactless payment cards.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="11.7.24."


><![CDATA[<p>Physically a SAM card can either be a separate component and plugged into a device when required or incorporated into an integrated circuit. A typically use is for the secure storage of cryptographic keys or other sensitive data. SAM hardware and software are designed to prevent information leakage and incorporates countermeasures against electromagnetic radiation, timing measurements, and other side channel attacks. These properties mean that SAMs offer a much higher level of protection than the terminals and readers, which often utilise general-purpose computers.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="11.7.25."


><![CDATA[<p>SAM’s typically support 3DES and AES cryptographic algorithms and SHA hashing algorithms in their hardware cryptographic co-processor implementations. Refer to Chapter 17 for information on approved cryptographic algorithms and protocols. It is important to note that 3DES is approved for use on legacy systems only and SHA-1 is not an approved hashing algorithm.</p>]]></paragraph>

<li><strong>Control over access to the system</strong> – only authorised entities can configure or add devices to the system, and all devices on the system are authentic and trustworthy;</li>

><![CDATA[<p>The AISEP programme has a number of recognition arrangements regarding evaluated products. Before choosing a product that has not been evaluated by the AISEP, agencies are encouraged to contact the GCSB to enquire whether the product will be recognised for New Zealand use once it has complete evaluation in a foreign scheme.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="12.1.17."


><![CDATA[<p>Two such recognition arrangements are for the Common Criteria Recognition Arrangement up to the assurance level of EAL2 with the lifecycle flaw remediation augmentation and for degausser products listed on the National Security Agency/Central Security Service’s EPLD.</p>]]></paragraph>

<ul>
<li>evaluation and certification of products using the Common Criteria;</li>
<li>continued maintenance of the assurance of evaluated products; and</li>
<li>recognition of products evaluated by a foreign scheme with which the AISEP has a mutual recognition agreement (generally the <a title="CCRA" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/ccra/index.cfm" target="_blank">Common Criteria Recognition Agreement – CCRA</a>).</li>

<block title="Protection Profiles"><paragraph
    title="12.1.20."


><![CDATA[<p>A Protection Profile (PP) describes the security functionality that must be included in a Common Criteria evaluation to meet a range of defined threats. PPs also define the activities to be taken to assess the security functions of a product. Agencies can have confidence that a product evaluated against an AISEP or GCSB approved PP addresses the defined threats. Approved PPs are published on the <a title="CPL" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/products/index.cfm" target="_blank">Certified Products List</a>.</p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="12.1.21."


><![CDATA[<p>The introduction of PP’s is to reduce the time required for evaluation, compared with the traditional approach to allow the AISEP to keep pace with the rapid evolution, production and release of security products and updates.  Cryptographic security functionality is included in the scope of evaluation against an approved Protection Profile. </p>]]></paragraph>
<paragraph
    title="12.1.22."


><![CDATA[<p>To facilitate the transition to AISEP approved Protection Profiles, a cap of Evaluation Assurance Level (EAL) 2 applies for all traditional AISEP (EAL based evaluations), including for technologies with no existing approved Protection Profile. EAL 2 is considered to represent a sensible trade-off between completion time and meaningful security assurance gains.</p>]]></paragraph>
