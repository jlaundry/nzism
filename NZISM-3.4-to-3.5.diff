>           <paragraph title="2.3.18.">Information security relates to the protection of information regardless of its form (electronic or physical).&#xA0; Within government, information security has traditionally been construed using the concepts of confidentiality, availability and integrity of information.</paragraph>
>           <paragraph title="2.3.19.">Relating these concepts to people who access, manage and use that information requires the use of methods to provide:
> Authentication;
> Authorisation; and
> Non-repudiation.
> </paragraph>
>           <paragraph title="2.3.20.">With the growth of the internet and cloud services, the proliferation of data and the growth in malicious and cyber-criminal activities, older methods of enabling information security are &#x201C;fragile&#x201D;, can be fragmented, and are in some cases, ineffective.</paragraph>
>           <paragraph title="2.3.21.">Zero Trust is a security concept based around the idea that systems and users should not be given access to any information without verification, even when they are connected to internal networks.&#xA0; Zero Trust looks to acknowledge that the previous concept and approach of using perimeter defences and providing free access within the secure perimeter is no longer practical or appropriate for securing information assets. As such, it should be replaced with robust authentication and verification steps being continuously performed.</paragraph>
>           <paragraph title="2.3.22.">The concept of Zero Trust provides a more complete means of providing information security in an internet and cloud environment.&#xA0; Understanding, planning for and preparing to adopt cloud services is an ideal time to incorporate Zero Trust concepts and principles into an agency&#x2019;s information security policies, operations and information handling, processing storage and disposal.</paragraph>

>           <paragraph title="2.4.3.">There has been a substantial amount of research on quantum computers &#x2013; machines that exploit quantum mechanical phenomena to solve mathematical problems that are difficult or intractable for conventional computers. The pace of this research is accelerating.</paragraph>
>           <paragraph title="2.4.4.">The development of quantum computing is a rapidly advancing area with multiple innovations being announced regularly, often eclipsing previous forecasts.</paragraph>
>           <paragraph title="2.4.5.">Quantum computers are not expected to fully replace classical computers as quantum effects are currently useful only on particular tasks. However quantum computers will be able to rapidly solve highly complex problems, well beyond the capabilities of today&#x2019;s supercomputers.</paragraph>
>           <paragraph title="2.4.6.">A prominent area of quantum computing applicability is in the field of cryptanalysis, and it is expected that they will be able to compromise or render ineffective many of the public-key cryptosystems currently in use.</paragraph>
>           <paragraph title="2.4.7.">It is important that agencies are aware of the potential impact developments in quantum computing are likely to have on critical security controls such as encryption.&#xA0; It is also important that they are preparing to act to minimise the disruptions that could be caused during migrations to post-quantum cryptography (cryptographic systems that remain secure after the widespread availability of quantum computing).</paragraph>
>           <paragraph title="2.4.8.">Currently there are no post-quantum cryptographic systems approved for use in the NZISM, however there are actions that agencies can undertake to prepare for the time when such systems are approved.</paragraph>
>         </block>
>         <block title="Post-Quantum Cryptographic Standards">
>           <paragraph title="2.4.9.">International organisations are evaluating potential candidates for standardisation in post-quantum cryptography.&#xA0; GCSB will review applicable standards and consider them for incorporation into the NZISM when they are published.</paragraph>
>           <paragraph title="2.4.10.">When standards for quantum-resistant public key cryptography become available, GCSB may deprecate or withdraw support for existing classical cryptographic standards. Agencies should therefore be prepared to transition away from these algorithms possibly in the next 2-3 years, even though the standards to migrate to are still to be developed.</paragraph>
>           <paragraph title="2.4.11.">Until new quantum-resistant algorithms are standardised, agencies should maintain or strengthen their existing cryptographic position using the algorithms, protocols and key lengths specified in Chapter 17 of the NZISM.</paragraph>

> Is the system a high value asset based on agency requirements?

>       <subsection title="Objective">
>         <paragraph title="5.9.1.">Agencies implement a Vulnerability Disclosure Policy (VDP) to enable members of the public to report vulnerabilities in the agency&#x2019;s public-facing systems and applications and receive feedback on such reports.</paragraph>
>       </subsection>
>       <subsection title="Context">
>         <block title="Scope">
>           <paragraph title="5.9.2.">This section provides information on vulnerability disclosure for all externally-facing agency systems, including public-facing systems.&#xA0; Vulnerability disclosure relating to internal systems is covered in Chapter 12 &#x2013; Product Security.&#xA0;</paragraph>
>           <paragraph title="5.9.3.">When selecting which systems, applications and data are within scope of a VDP, agencies may consider:
> The sensitivity of information on the agency&#x2019;s systems, including financial data, medical information, proprietary information, customer data or other personally identifiable information (PII).
> Security safeguards that are already in place on the system, such as encryption of data at rest.
> The agency&#x2019;s ability to segment its network or otherwise segregate sensitive information stored on its systems.
> Regulatory, contractual, privacy or other restrictions placed on disclosure of protected classes of information (such as within the New Zealand Classification System).
> </paragraph>
>           <paragraph title="5.9.4.">Reference to other chapters and sections in this document is essential.&#xA0; In particular:
> Chapter 4 - System Certification and Accreditation;
> Chapter 5 &#x2013; Information Security Documentation;
> Section 6.2 - Vulnerability Analysis;
> Section 6.3 - Change Management;
> Chapter 7 &#x2013; Information Security Incidents;

>         </block>
>         <block title="Agencies must expect vulnerabilities">
>           <paragraph title="5.9.5.">Invariably all software, operating systems and applications have the potential to house exploitable vulnerabilities.&#xA0; Many vulnerabilities are identified by users and other third parties. Some vulnerabilities may be undiscovered or inherent in the application or software.&#xA0; Others may be introduced during upgrades, patches, configuration or other changes.&#xA0;</paragraph>
>           <paragraph title="5.9.6.">It is essential that agencies establish a policy and processes to identify and remediate such vulnerabilities.</paragraph>
>         </block>
>         <block title="Agencies must establish a vulnerability reporting mechanism">
>           <paragraph title="5.9.7.">Published VDPs demonstrate that an agency has a mature and constructive approach when they receive a vulnerability report and also demonstrates openness and transparency in the management of agency systems.</paragraph>
>           <paragraph title="5.9.8.">Agencies should establish a process to allow any user (whether a member of the public, business partners, other agencies or agency staff), to report potential vulnerabilities.&#xA0; Any such reporting is on a &#x201C;no blame&#x201D; basis, without fear of repercussion or penalty, provided the agency&#x2019;s disclosure policy is followed and no illegal activity is undertaken.</paragraph>
>           <paragraph title="5.9.9.">The VDP must clearly state the conditions under which reports are received.&#xA0; In general terms this also includes a &#x201C;no bug bounty&#x201D; clause as well as limits on web site, system or application probing.</paragraph>
>           <paragraph title="5.9.10.">An agency&#x2019;s VDP will necessarily reflect that they may not control or own all of the software they use or the maintenance and development of underlying software (such as compilers, programming or scripting languages and so on).&#xA0; The VDP should clearly state that while the agency can receive reports about software, systems or services run on their behalf by third parties, providers or vendors, they may have to work with the reporting party to report the vulnerability to the relevant vendor.</paragraph>
>           <paragraph title="5.9.11.">Where specific legislation applies, for example a reported vulnerability may breach the Privacy Act, agencies must adhere to the legislation.&#xA0; This may change how reports are managed and action communicated to the finder or reporter.&#xA0; This does not change the requirement to maintain communication with the reporter/finder.</paragraph>
>         </block>
>         <block title="Agencies are expected to find and remediate vulnerabilities">
>           <paragraph title="5.9.12.">The Protective Security Requirements places clear expectations on agencies to maintain awareness of vulnerabilities (see mandatory requirement INFOSEC4).</paragraph>
>           <paragraph title="5.9.13.">Section 12.4 of the NZISM sets out expectations and controls to ensure security patches are applied in a timely manner.</paragraph>
>           <paragraph title="5.9.14.">The disclosure period commonly used by many vendors, manufacturers and government agencies is 90 days.&#xA0; Vulnerabilities will be either patched, mitigated or managed within this period.&#xA0; In some cases earlier notification is provided to allow users to take mitigating actions until a patch or other solution is available.</paragraph>
>           <paragraph title="5.9.15.">VDPs are expected to include a timeframe within which patches will be applied or remedial action taken when a vulnerability is reported to the agency.</paragraph>
>         </block>
>         <block title="Agencies to create a vulnerability reporting point">
>           <paragraph title="5.9.16.">When security risks in agency services are discovered and reported to the agency, it is vital that a robust communication channel is available to receive the report.</paragraph>
>           <paragraph title="5.9.17.">This is commonly described as a &#x201C;security.txt&#x201D;.&#xA0; A draft standard has been published (see References below) to help agencies (and other organisations) outline a process for security researchers to securely report security vulnerabilities.</paragraph>
>         </block>
>         <block title="Vulnerability disclosure policies are a normal part of learning about and patching vulnerabilities">
>           <paragraph title="5.9.18.">Vulnerability disclosure (sometimes also referred to as responsible disclosure or coordinated vulnerability disclosure) is now an internationally accepted practice for technology organisations.&#xA0; The practice of vulnerability disclosure in modern computing dates to the late 1980s.&#xA0; There are related examples (non-computing) which appeared in the mid-1800s when locksmiths exchanged vulnerability information.</paragraph>
>         </block>
>         <block title="Bug Bounties">
>           <paragraph title="5.9.19.">&#x201C;Bug bounties&#x201D; are a monetary reward to security researchers for the discovery and reporting of software and other information system vulnerabilities to the agency.&#xA0; Bug Bounties are separate to VDPs and should only be covered if the agency has a bug bounty programme in place.</paragraph>
>         </block>
>         <block title="Vulnerability disclosure policy (VDP) Content">
>           <paragraph title="5.9.20.">A VDP will typically include:
> A scoping statement setting out which systems the policy applies to (e.g. the agency&#x2019;s website and other public-facing systems);
> Details of how finders can contact the agency&#x2019;s security team (including any public keys for encrypting reports);
> Permitted activities;
> Acknowledgement of reports and a response time (typically 60 or 90 days) for corrections, adjustments, or other &#x201C;fixes&#x201D;;
> Reporters/finders agreeing to not share information about the vulnerability until the end of the disclosure period, to let the organisation fix the issues before it becomes public;
> Illegal activities are not permitted (specifying any relevant legislation, such as the Crimes Act, the Privacy Act etc.); and
> Either a statement that bug bounties will not be paid for any discoveries, or information about the agency&#x2019;s bug bounty programme.

> Identity and Access Management
> 
> 
> Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a framework of business processes, policies and technologies that enable and support the management of electronic or digital identities, authorisation, privileges and access to organisational resources.
> Identity management deals with attributes related to a user (including people, machines, devices and systems).&#xA0;Access Management applies organisation processes, policies and security to enable and manage access.&#xA0;The two aspects are highly interdependent and are most effectively managed conjointly.&#xA0;An IAM framework is a key element in Privileged Access Management (PAM) and Zero Trust architectures.

< Segregation may be achieved by isolation, enforcing separation of key elements of a virtual system, removing network connectivity to the relevant device or applying access controls to prevent or limit access.
---
> Segregation includes the development, enforcement and monitoring of rules in order to control access to systems and information and to manage or restrict the communication between network components, devices, hosts and service.&#xA0; Segregation is essential in all networks but particularly in entirely virtual networks, such as cloud-hosted networks.
22445c24631,24639
< Separation is a physical distinction between elements of a network or between networks.&#xA0; This applies in both physical and virtual systems architectures
