+          <paragraph title="17.1.13.">
+          It is important to note that when agencies use encryption for data at rest or in transit, they are not reducing the classification of the information. When encryption is used the potential risk of disclosure of the information is reduced.

+          <paragraph title="17.1.14.">

-          Where agencies outsource the management of data centres it follows that they do NOT have direct control over the data centre and related gateways.  In other cases the operation of systems within an agency are also outsourced.  In such cases encryption MUST be applied at the transmitting device as this is the logical point at which direct agency control ceases.  In large agencies, this is likely to be impractical and creates a significant key management overhead.  Encryption for routine traffic originating at the transmitting device is therefore likely to occur only in exceptional cases or where special protection is required.

-          <paragraph title="17.1.39.">
-          The determination of when and where a communication/transmission leaves direct agency control will depend on a number of factors including:
-The scope and extent of outsourcing and information systems support agreements with service providers;
-Service agreements with ISP’s, Telcos and other communication service providers;
-The agency’s system architecture and security architecture.  In particular the boundary where direct agency control ceases.  In traditional network architectures this was described as the “gateway”;
-Key management and control of the application of keys when encrypting/decrypting;

           <paragraph title="17.1.3.">
-          Encryption is primarily used to provide confidentiality protecting against the risk of information being exploited by an attacker. More broadly, cryptography can also provide authentication, non-repudiation and integrity. Cryptography is also used in the establishment of secure connectivity, such as IPSEC VPNs.
+          Cryptography is primarily used to support:
+Confidentiality – protecting against the risk of information being disclosed to an unauthorised person;
+Authentication – ensuring a person or entity is who they claim to be;
+Integrity – ensuring information has not been compromised, either deliberately or accidentally; and
+Non-repudiation – proving who (or what) performed an action.
           </paragraph>
           <paragraph title="17.1.4.">
-          The use of approved encryption will generally reduce the likelihood of an unauthorised party gaining access to the information contained within the encrypted data.
+          Cryptography is an important control for data protection. The encryption selected may change depending on the classification of the data.  It is important to note that classification, in itself, provides no protection but is merely a labelling mechanism to indicate the degree of protection and care required in handling that data.

-          Cryptography is an important control for data protection and the encryption selected will depend on the classification of the data.  Note that classification, in itself, provides no protection but is merely indicative of the degree of protection and care in handling required for that level of classification.

+          Mitigation of the risks when using older cryptographic algorithms, often takes the form of increased key lengths.  Agencies should also note the increasing threat posed by the evolution and development of quantum computing (see 17.1.19 - Quantum Computing and Encryption).

-        <block title="Retiring RSA ">
-          <paragraph title="17.1.18.">
-          RSA was announced in 1976 so it is now over 40 years old. Several flaws and attacks have been identified since creation, each of which required specific mitigations, careful implementation and management.  Unfortunately there is ample evidence that implementers continue to have difficulties in securely implementing, using and managing RSA.
-          </paragraph>
+        <block title="Quantum Computing and Encryption">
           <paragraph title="17.1.19.">
-          To counter identified threats from shorter RSA key lengths, longer key lengths have been specified in the NZISM since 2010.  Subsequently it was specified in the NZISM that RSA was approved for use in legacy systems only.
+          Developments in quantum computing have highlighted threats to classical cryptography whereby a quantum computing, can undermine all of the widely used public key algorithms used for key establishment and digital signatures.  While this may be not an immediate issue, quantum developments are likely to undermine the effectiveness of encryption being used today to protect confidentiality of information.
           </paragraph>
           <paragraph title="17.1.20.">
-          This approach was selected to allow agencies to plan the retirement of legacy systems and ensure replacement systems were using only approved algorithms and protocols.
+          A further implication is that historical and archived data protected by encryption may be at risk.
           </paragraph>
           <paragraph title="17.1.21.">
-          There are several indicators that RSA will be deprecated in the next few years.  For example TLS 1.3 deprecates RSA in favour of elliptic curve cryptography.  The most recent guidance from NIST is also indicative of impending deprecation of RSA.
+          It is generally accepted that symmetric encryption, with sufficiently long keys, will remain quantum resistant in the short term but that quantum resistant replacements for digital signature and key establishment algorithms will be required in the near future.
           </paragraph>
           <paragraph title="17.1.22.">
-          It is, therefore essential that agencies are aware of these changes and plan the retirement of RSA from their systems as part of their ongoing operational management.
+          In the longer term, quantum resistant algorithms are expected to be developed, standardised and approved for use.  Until such time, however, agencies should be positioning themselves to be ready to migrate to a “post-quantum encryption” environment.
+          </paragraph>
+          <paragraph title="17.1.23.">
+          As it is now recognised that agencies will need to undertake future migration activities related to post-quantum encryption, it is no longer specifically advised to invest in migration from RSA to ECC-based algorithms if that has not already taken place.  Emphasis should instead be placed on ensuring minimum key lengths specified in the NZISM are adhered to.

+          <paragraph title="17.1.26.">
+          RSA was announced in 1976 and is now over 45 years old. Several flaws and attacks have been identified since creation, each of which required specific mitigations, careful implementation and management.  Unfortunately there is ample evidence that implementers continue to have difficulties in securely implementing, using and managing RSA.
+          </paragraph>
+          <paragraph title="17.1.27.">
+          To counter identified threats from shorter RSA key lengths, longer key lengths have been specified in the NZISM since 2010.  Minimum key lengths have been subsequently increased over time.

+          <paragraph title="17.1.28.">
+          For a number of years there had been several indicators that RSA was likely to be deprecated by the cryptographic community and standards bodies.  For example, TLS 1.3 has deprecated the use of RSA for key exchange in favour of elliptic curve cryptography, but RSA is still supported for digital signatures in the current standard.  Previous guidance from NIST was also indicative of the impending deprecation of RSA.  However, subsequent guidance no longer recommends moving from RSA to elliptic curve if that has not already been done.

+          <paragraph title="17.1.29.">
+          Therefore, while RSA is not fully deprecated in the NZISM, it is approved ONLY for a limited set of uses as described in Section 17.2 – Approved Cryptographic Algorithms.

           In all cases a comprehensive risk assessment should be undertaken before configurations are selected.  Some general principles to be considered are:
-Long, complex passwords are stronger than short passwords;
-Long keys generally provide stronger encryption than short keys;
-Asymmetric encryption is slower than symmetric encryption;
-Symmetric encryption is generally recommended when the key is stored locally only;
-Asymmetric encryption is recommended when keys need to be shared across communication channels;
-If you are encrypting very large volumes of data, encrypting the data using a symmetric key, and encrypting the symmetric key with an asymmetric key may be more operationally effective;
-Normally encrypted data cannot be compressed, but compressed data can be encrypted.  Data should be compressed before encryption.
-Any risk assessment should include consideration of key management - refer to 17.9 Key Management
+Cryptographic strength is determined by a combination of the encryption algorithm being used, the encryption protocol and the key length.  Longer keys generally provide increased encryption strength over shorter keys when using the same encryption algorithm;
+Asymmetric cryptographic algorithms are slower than symmetric cryptographic algorithms at an equivalent cryptographic strength;
+Asymmetric cryptographic algorithms are recommended for the exchange of symmetric cryptographic keys when they are needed to be shared across communication channels;
+Encrypted data cannot usually be compressed, but compressed data can be encrypted.  Data should be compressed before encryption;

           All cryptographic keys have a limited useful life after which the key should be replaced or retired. Typically the useful life of the cryptographic key (cryptoperiod) is use, product and situation dependant. Product guidance is the best source of information on establishing cryptoperiods for individual products. A more practical control is the use of data, disk or volume encryption where key changes are more easily managed. Selection of cryptoperiods should be based on a risk assessment. Refer also to section 17.9 – Key Management.

-          Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) is a block cipher mode of operation that uses universal hashing over a binary Galois field to provide authenticated encryption. It can be implemented in hardware to achieve high speeds with low cost and low latency.  Software implementations of GCM can achieve excellent performance by using table-driven field operations.  It uses mechanisms that are supported by a well-understood theoretical foundation with security is based on the security of the block cipher.

-          The two functions that comprise AES/GCM are described as authenticated encryption and authenticated decryption.  The authenticated encryption function encrypts the data and computes an authentication tag.  The authenticated decryption function decrypts the data, contingent on the verification of the tag.

-          Implementation of AES may restrict the data to be encrypted to the non-confidential data. This variant of GCM is called GMAC.

+          Zero Trust is a security concept based around the idea that systems and users should not be given access to any information without verification, even when they are connected to internal networks.  Zero Trust looks to acknowledge that the previous concept and approach of using perimeter defences and providing free access within the secure perimeter is no longer practical or appropriate for securing information assets. As such, it should be replaced with robust authentication and verification steps being continuously performed.

+    <section title="2.4. Preparation for Post-Quantum Cryptography">
+      <subsection title="Context">
+        <block title="Background">
+          <paragraph title="2.4.3.">
+          There has been a substantial amount of research on quantum computers – machines that exploit quantum mechanical phenomena to solve mathematical problems that are difficult or intractable for conventional computers. The pace of this research is accelerating.
+          </paragraph>
+          <paragraph title="2.4.4.">
+          The development of quantum computing is a rapidly advancing area with multiple innovations being announced regularly, often eclipsing previous forecasts.
+          </paragraph>
+          <paragraph title="2.4.5.">
+          Quantum computers are not expected to fully replace classical computers as quantum effects are currently useful only on particular tasks. However quantum computers will be able to rapidly solve highly complex problems, well beyond the capabilities of today’s supercomputers.
+          </paragraph>
+          <paragraph title="2.4.6.">
+          A prominent area of quantum computing applicability is in the field of cryptanalysis, and it is expected that they will be able to compromise or render ineffective many of the public-key cryptosystems currently in use.
+          </paragraph>
+          <paragraph title="2.4.7.">
+          It is important that agencies are aware of the potential impact developments in quantum computing are likely to have on critical security controls such as encryption.  It is also important that they are preparing to act to minimise the disruptions that could be caused during migrations to post-quantum cryptography (cryptographic systems that remain secure after the widespread availability of quantum computing).
+          </paragraph>
+          <paragraph title="2.4.8.">
+          Currently there are no post-quantum cryptographic systems approved for use in the NZISM, however there are actions that agencies can undertake to prepare for the time when such systems are approved.
+          </paragraph>
+        </block>
+        <block title="Post-Quantum Cryptographic Standards">
+          <paragraph title="2.4.10.">
+          When standards for quantum-resistant public key cryptography become available, GCSB may deprecate or withdraw support for existing classical cryptographic standards. Agencies should therefore be prepared to transition away from these algorithms possibly in the next 2-3 years, even though the standards to migrate to are still to be developed.
+          </paragraph>
+          <paragraph title="2.4.11.">
+          Until new quantum-resistant algorithms are standardised, agencies should maintain or strengthen their existing cryptographic position using the algorithms, protocols and key lengths specified in Chapter 17 of the NZISM.
+          </paragraph>
+          <paragraph title="2.4.9.">
+          International organisations are evaluating potential candidates for standardisation in post-quantum cryptography.  GCSB will review applicable standards and consider them for incorporation into the NZISM when they are published.
+          </paragraph>
+        </block>
+        <block title="Scope">
+          <paragraph title="2.4.2.">
+          This section provides information for agencies to assist with preparation for the impacts of quantum computing on information security, and more specifically impacts related to encryption.
+          </paragraph>
+        </block>
+      </subsection>
+      <subsection title="Objective">
+        <paragraph title="2.4.1.">
+        Agencies are prepared for the impacts that widespread availability of quantum computing will have on information security.
+        </paragraph>
+      </subsection>
+      <subsection title="Rationale & Controls">
+        <block title="Post-Quantum Cryptography Preparation">
+          <paragraph title="2.4.13.">
+          International organisations are in the process of developing standards for post-quantum cryptographic algorithms. The standards will be reviewed and incorporated into the NZISM as they are published.
+          </paragraph>
+          <paragraph title="2.4.14.">
+          As standards are still under development the form of post-quantum cryptography is not fully determined at this point in time.
+          </paragraph>
+          <paragraph title="2.4.15.">
+          It is recognised that providing guidance on the concrete and achievable steps that can be taken now to prepare for the transition to post-quantum cryptography will help ensure a smooth and efficient transition to any new standards that become available.
+          </paragraph>
+          <paragraph title="2.4.16.">
+          Agencies SHOULD ensure they are aware of the latest developments in post-quantum cryptography.  GCSB is tracking these developments and will continue to provide advice through the NZISM.
+          </paragraph>
+          <paragraph title="2.4.17.">
+          Agencies SHOULD maintain an inventory of sensitive and critical datasets that must be secured for an extended amount of time.  This will ensure datasets that may be at risk now and decrypted once a cryptographically relevant quantum computer is available are not secured solely through the use of quantum vulnerable cryptography.
+          </paragraph>
+          <paragraph title="2.4.18.">
+          Agencies SHOULD conduct an inventory of systems using cryptographic technologies to determine the potential size and scope of future transition work once post-quantum cryptographic systems become available.
+          </paragraph>
+          <paragraph title="2.4.19.">
+          Agencies SHOULD identify which systems in their inventory rely on public key cryptography and note them as quantum vulnerable in agency risk assessments.
+          </paragraph>
+          <paragraph title="2.4.20.">
+          Agencies SHOULD determine a priority order for quantum vulnerable systems to be transitioned from classical cryptography to post-quantum cryptography.
+          </paragraph>
+          <paragraph title="2.4.21.">
+          Agencies SHOULD consider the following factors when prioritising the quantum vulnerable systems:
+Is the system a high value asset based on agency requirements?
+Does the system protect sensitive information (e.g. key stores, passwords, root keys, signing keys, personally identifiable information, and classified information)?
+Do other systems (internal or external to the agency) depend on the cryptographic protections in place on the quantum vulnerable system?
+How long does the data need to be protected?
+          </paragraph>
+          <paragraph title="2.4.22.">
+          Using the inventory and prioritisation information, agencies SHOULD develop a plan for system transitions upon publication of the new post-quantum cryptographic standard.
+          </paragraph>

+Identity and Access Management
+

+Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a framework of business processes, policies and technologies that enable and support the management of electronic or digital identities, authorisation, privileges and access to organisational resources.
+Identity management deals with attributes related to a user (including people, machines, devices and systems). Access Management applies organisation processes, policies and security to enable and manage access. The two aspects are highly interdependent and are most effectively managed conjointly. An IAM framework is a key element in Privileged Access Management (PAM) and Zero Trust architectures.

+    <section title="5.9. Vulnerability Disclosure Policy (VDP)">
+      <subsection title="Context">
+        <block title="Agencies are expected to find and remediate vulnerabilities">
+          <paragraph title="5.9.12.">
+          The Protective Security Requirements places clear expectations on agencies to maintain awareness of vulnerabilities (see mandatory requirement INFOSEC4).
+          </paragraph>
+          <paragraph title="5.9.13.">
+          Section 12.4 of the NZISM sets out expectations and controls to ensure security patches are applied in a timely manner.
+          </paragraph>
+          <paragraph title="5.9.14.">
+          The disclosure period commonly used by many vendors, manufacturers and government agencies is 90 days.  Vulnerabilities will be either patched, mitigated or managed within this period.  In some cases earlier notification is provided to allow users to take mitigating actions until a patch or other solution is available.
+          </paragraph>
+          <paragraph title="5.9.15.">
+          VDPs are expected to include a timeframe within which patches will be applied or remedial action taken when a vulnerability is reported to the agency.
+          </paragraph>
+        </block>
+        <block title="Agencies must establish a vulnerability reporting mechanism">
+          <paragraph title="5.9.10.">
+          An agency’s VDP will necessarily reflect that they may not control or own all of the software they use or the maintenance and development of underlying software (such as compilers, programming or scripting languages and so on).  The VDP should clearly state that while the agency can receive reports about software, systems or services run on their behalf by third parties, providers or vendors, they may have to work with the reporting party to report the vulnerability to the relevant vendor.
+          </paragraph>
+          <paragraph title="5.9.11.">
+          Where specific legislation applies, for example a reported vulnerability may breach the Privacy Act, agencies must adhere to the legislation.  This may change how reports are managed and action communicated to the finder or reporter.  This does not change the requirement to maintain communication with the reporter/finder.
+          </paragraph>
+          <paragraph title="5.9.7.">
+          Published VDPs demonstrate that an agency has a mature and constructive approach when they receive a vulnerability report and also demonstrates openness and transparency in the management of agency systems.
+          </paragraph>
+          <paragraph title="5.9.8.">
+          Agencies should establish a process to allow any user (whether a member of the public, business partners, other agencies or agency staff), to report potential vulnerabilities.  Any such reporting is on a “no blame” basis, without fear of repercussion or penalty, provided the agency’s disclosure policy is followed and no illegal activity is undertaken.
+          </paragraph>
+          <paragraph title="5.9.9.">
+          The VDP must clearly state the conditions under which reports are received.  In general terms this also includes a “no bug bounty” clause as well as limits on web site, system or application probing.
+          </paragraph>
+        </block>
+        <block title="Agencies must expect vulnerabilities">
+          <paragraph title="5.9.5.">
+          Invariably all software, operating systems and applications have the potential to house exploitable vulnerabilities.  Many vulnerabilities are identified by users and other third parties. Some vulnerabilities may be undiscovered or inherent in the application or software.  Others may be introduced during upgrades, patches, configuration or other changes.
+          </paragraph>
+          <paragraph title="5.9.6.">
+          It is essential that agencies establish a policy and processes to identify and remediate such vulnerabilities.
+          </paragraph>
+        </block>
+        <block title="Agencies to create a vulnerability reporting point">
+          <paragraph title="5.9.16.">
+          When security risks in agency services are discovered and reported to the agency, it is vital that a robust communication channel is available to receive the report.
+          </paragraph>
+          <paragraph title="5.9.17.">
+          This is commonly described as a “security.txt”.  A draft standard has been published (see References below) to help agencies (and other organisations) outline a process for security researchers to securely report security vulnerabilities.
+          </paragraph>
+        </block>
+        <block title="Bug Bounties">
+          <paragraph title="5.9.19.">
+          “Bug bounties” are a monetary reward to security researchers for the discovery and reporting of software and other information system vulnerabilities to the agency.  Bug Bounties are separate to VDPs and should only be covered if the agency has a bug bounty programme in place.
+          </paragraph>
+        </block>
+        <block title="Scope">
+          <paragraph title="5.9.2.">
+          This section provides information on vulnerability disclosure for all externally-facing agency systems, including public-facing systems.  Vulnerability disclosure relating to internal systems is covered in Chapter 12 – Product Security.
+          </paragraph>
+          <paragraph title="5.9.3.">
+          When selecting which systems, applications and data are within scope of a VDP, agencies may consider:
+The sensitivity of information on the agency’s systems, including financial data, medical information, proprietary information, customer data or other personally identifiable information (PII).
+Security safeguards that are already in place on the system, such as encryption of data at rest.
+The agency’s ability to segment its network or otherwise segregate sensitive information stored on its systems.
+Regulatory, contractual, privacy or other restrictions placed on disclosure of protected classes of information (such as within the New Zealand Classification System).
+          </paragraph>
+          <paragraph title="5.9.4.">
+          Reference to other chapters and sections in this document is essential.  In particular:
+Chapter 4 - System Certification and Accreditation;
+Chapter 5 – Information Security Documentation;
+Section 6.2 - Vulnerability Analysis;
+Section 6.3 - Change Management;
+Chapter 7 – Information Security Incidents;
+Section 12.4 – Product Patching and Updating;
+Chapter 14 - Software Security.
+          </paragraph>
+        </block>
+        <block title="Vulnerability disclosure policies are a normal part of learning about and patching vulnerabilities">
+          <paragraph title="5.9.18.">
+          Vulnerability disclosure (sometimes also referred to as responsible disclosure or coordinated vulnerability disclosure) is now an internationally accepted practice for technology organisations.  The practice of vulnerability disclosure in modern computing dates to the late 1980s.  There are related examples (non-computing) which appeared in the mid-1800s when locksmiths exchanged vulnerability information.
+          </paragraph>
+        </block>
+        <block title="Vulnerability disclosure policy (VDP) Content">
+          <paragraph title="5.9.20.">
+          A VDP will typically include:
+A scoping statement setting out which systems the policy applies to (e.g. the agency’s website and other public-facing systems);
+Details of how finders can contact the agency’s security team (including any public keys for encrypting reports);
+Permitted activities;
+Acknowledgement of reports and a response time (typically 60 or 90 days) for corrections, adjustments, or other “fixes”;
+Reporters/finders agreeing to not share information about the vulnerability until the end of the disclosure period, to let the organisation fix the issues before it becomes public;
+Illegal activities are not permitted (specifying any relevant legislation, such as the Crimes Act, the Privacy Act etc.); and
+Either a statement that bug bounties will not be paid for any discoveries, or information about the agency’s bug bounty programme.

+      <subsection title="Objective">
+        <paragraph title="5.9.1.">
