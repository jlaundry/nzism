> Root, Domain and other Administrator accounts are typically used for installing, updating and removing software, changing configurations and administering system passwords.
> Service Accounts, which may include local or domain accounts, are typically used for running processes, such as web servers, database servers, and application servers.&#xA0; These may also include the ability to change passwords.
> Emergency Accounts, sometimes referred to as &#x201C;DRP&#x201D;, &#x201C;firecall&#x201D; or &#x201C;breakglass&#x201D; accounts.&#xA0; While access to emergency accounts normally requires managerial approval as a security measure, they are typically an inefficient manual process with limited auditability.
> System or Application Accounts are characteristically used by devices and systems for running operating system components and owning related files.
> </paragraph><paragraph title="16.4.10.">Traditional administrative or management solutions are typically based on strong password management.&#xA0; Modern systems, especially in a cloud environment, require a more structured and robust means of access control and management.&#xA0; This should include the use of Multi-Factor Authentication (See Section 16.7 - Multi-factor Authentication) to provide access to Privileged Accounts.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.4.11.">In secure environments, privileged accounts should be reserved for network and system administrators to manage the access to and oversight of sensitive information and resources in support of normal agency or organisational operations.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.4.12.">The characteristics and capability of privileged accounts are described at 16.3.3.&#xA0; It is important to note that systems themselves, as well as human users, may have privileged account access.&#xA0; As such it is important to clearly and individually identify all real persons, systems and devices with privileged account access.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.4.13.">Access accounts or channels may have the following characteristics:
> Regular access channels&#x2014;protected channels that are subject to standard IT controls;
> Privileged access channels (PACs)&#x2014; channels that might circumvent regular controls but are deemed necessary and legitimate operational channels for reasons of practicality or cost;
> Unintended channels not demanded by any technical or business requirement and represent a vulnerability.
> </paragraph></block><block title="Attacks on Privileged Accounts"><paragraph title="16.4.14.">Privileged accounts frequently allow unrestricted access the IT infrastructure, often including data residing on those systems.&#xA0; The very high level of access and capability associated with privileged accounts makes them a prime target for external attackers and malicious insiders.&#xA0; A compromise of a privileged account can be extremely damaging and may even cripple systems, such as in ransomware attacks.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.4.15.">Compromised privileged accounts represent one of the largest security vulnerabilities an organisation can face today.&#xA0; A compromise will allow attackers to take full control of an organisation&#x2019;s IT infrastructure, disable security controls, steal confidential information, commit financial fraud and disrupt operations.&#xA0; Stolen, abused or misused privileged credentials are identified in a very high proportion of successful breaches.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.4.16.">Common attack methods may include:
> Probes and scans;
> endpoint targeting;
> System and design vulnerability exploitation;
> Social engineering (including phishing, email spoofing, etc); and
> Malware implants.
> </paragraph></block><block title="Governance and Control"><paragraph title="16.4.17.">Privileged Accounts are frequently used to deploy and maintain IT systems and necessarily exist in nearly every connected device, server, database, and application.&#xA0; Privileged Accounts may extend beyond an agency-controlled IT infrastructure to include, for example, employee-managed corporate social media accounts.&#xA0; Most agencies and other organisations can typically have many more privileged accounts than employees, sometimes as many as two or three times the number of employees.&#xA0; It is not unusual for some privileged accounts to be unidentified, overlooked, unmanaged, and therefore unprotected.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.4.18.">Governance ensures that privileged accounts are properly approved, controlled, monitored and decommissioned throughout their entire lifecycle.&#xA0; A PAM Policy defines the roles, policies and mechanisms for access requests, as well as the workflow for privileged access approvals and delivery.&#xA0; Monitoring and auditing ensure that account permissions and usage remain appropriate over time.&#xA0; PAM governance is a fundamental part of IT Governance as it can influence other IT security systems, such as identity and access management systems.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.4.19.">In order to support strong IT Governance, it is vital that security efforts are coordinated and technology investment managed.&#xA0; This includes the integration of PAM into the Information Security Policy, Systems Architecture, IT Security Strategy and Risk Management Plan. The sensitivity of data and operations should be assessed by undertaking an impact assessment.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.4.20.">Underpinning any PAM is the principle of enforcement of least privilege.&#xA0; This is defined as the minimisation of access rights and permissions for users, accounts, applications, systems, devices and computing processes to the absolute minimum necessary in order to perform routine, authorised activities and maintain the safe and secure operation of agency or organisational systems.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.4.21.">Enforcing the principle of least privilege assists agencies in minimising their systems attack surface, supporting audit and compliance though improved visibility.&#xA0; This also can reduce risk, complexity, and costs for agencies.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.4.22.">Provision of unnecessary system privileges or data access rights will magnify the impact of misuse or compromise of that users account and can even be devastating. &#xA0;Account privileges should be established to provide a reasonable but minimal level of system privileges and rights needed in order to support the purpose and role. &#xA0;The granting of elevated or excessive system privileges should be carefully controlled and managed.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.4.23.">Risks associated with access to privileged accounts include:
> Misuse of privileges;
> Increased attacker capability;
> Circumventing established security and oversight controls;
> Severe system disruption or failure; and
> Significant data compromise and/or loss.
> </paragraph><paragraph title="16.4.24.">The principles of PAM controls are to:
> Establish and maintain an inventory of privileged accounts;
> Assess the risk(s) of each privileged access channel;
> Enforce the principle of least privilege;
> Use two-factor or Multi-Factor Authentication for access to Privileged Accounts;
> Minimise access to only essential activities;
> Minimise the number of privileged access channels;
> Ensure each channel and user can be uniquely identified (prevent or minimise sharing of credentials, particularly with accounts such as &#x201C;root&#x201D; or &#x201C;admin&#x201D;);
> Ensure operational systems have access to compiled code only;
> Ensure source code is created, managed and stored on non-operational systems only;
> Restrict access to source code (deny-by-default);
> Log all access to source code including the detection, evaluation, recording and termination of privileged access channels;
> Ensure all logs are periodically reviewed;
> Ensure strong and strict change control procedures are implemented;
> Ensure the authorisation, activation and deactivation of privileged access channels is strictly enforced; and
> Regularly audit and review PAM controls.
> </paragraph><paragraph title="16.4.25.">It is also important to define all privileged accounts used by an agency or by other organisations, particularly where outsource arrangements are in place. &#xA0;It is fundamental for robust security to identify and record the business functions, related data, systems and access privileges.&#xA0; This is particularly important for agencies that create, store and process classified data.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.4.26.">Without a comprehensive privileged accounts inventory, agencies and other organisations may overlook &#x201C;backdoor&#x201D; accounts which allow users to bypass proper controls and auditing. &#xA0;These may have been created during system development, by malicious insiders or by external attackers.&#xA0; Such unregistered accounts may be undetected for months or even years and can create a means of unauthorised and unmonitored access.&#xA0; Such accounts may also be used to erase activity logs to avoid detection.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.4.27.">A privileged access inventory should include a description of the IT system, information asset, privilege description, users and risk classification.&#xA0; This is essential information for assessing risk, the determining of controls and for identifying and managing use and misuse.&#xA0; Of note are:
> Local or Domain Server Admin accounts;
> Domain Admin accounts that typically control Active Directory users;
> System Admin accounts that manage databases;
> Root accounts that manage Unix/Linux platforms;
> Accounts that run and manage Windows applications, services, and scheduled tasks;
> IIS application pools (.NET applications);
> Networking equipment accounts that give access to firewalls, routers, switches, session border controllers, gateways and other similar devices, whether physical or virtual.
> </paragraph><paragraph title="16.4.28.">Privileged Access Management systems provide many of the capabilities and controls briefly described above and can facilitate PAM, as well as supporting strong IT Governance.</paragraph></block></subsection><subsection title="References"><paragraph title="16.4.29.">Additional information relating to Privileged Account and access management, including some policy examples, can be found at:

This principle stipulates the minimisation of access rights and permissions for users, accounts, applications, systems, devices and computing processes to the absolute minimum necessary in order to perform routine, authorised activities and maintain the safe and secure operation of agency or organisational systems.&#xA0;</paragraph><paragraph title="16.4.31.R.02.">The implementation of the Principle of Least Privilege requires limitations on the number and use of privileged accounts as well as minimising the numbers of users with these privileges.&#xA0;</paragraph><paragraph title="16.4.31.R.03.">The use of Privileged Access should also follow the principle of least privilege by ensuring the use of two-factor or Multi-Factor Authentication for access to Privileged Accounts and ensuring that only activity requiring such access is undertaken.&#xA0; Refer to Section 16.7 &#x2013; Multi-Factor Authentication.&#xA0; User accounts without Privileged Access should be used for all other activities.&#xA0; Refer to Section 16.3 &#x2013; Privileged User Access.&#xA0;</paragraph><paragraph title="16.4.31.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Must" CID="6842">Agencies MUST apply the Principle of Least Privilege when developing and implementing a Privileged Access Management (PAM) policy.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.4.31.C.02." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="6843">Agencies SHOULD use two-factor or Multi-Factor Authentication to allow access to Privileged Accounts.</paragraph></block><block title=" Strong Authentication process"><paragraph title="16.4.32.R.01.">The approval and authorisation process for the granting of privileged access should be based on the requirement to manage and protect agency systems and assets or as an operational necessity only.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.4.32.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Must" CID="6846">As part of a Privileged Access Management (PAM) policy, agencies MUST establish and implement a strong approval and authorisation process before any privileged access credentials are issued.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.4.32.C.02." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Must Not" CID="6847">Privileged Access credentials MUST NOT be issued until approval has been formally granted.</paragraph></block><block title=" Suspension and Revocation of Privileged Access Credentials"><paragraph title="16.4.33.R.01.">Because Privileged Accounts have high levels of trust associated with the issue of related credentials, any indication that credentials or accounts have been compromised or that credentials have been misused must be immediately investigated.&#xA0; Actions may include the immediate suspension of credentials.&#xA0; Revocation may follow depending on the outcome of the investigation.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.4.33.R.02.">The privileged access credentials for staff and other users (such as authorised contractors) should be suspended or revoked as part of exit procedures when staff leave the agency and when other users no longer undertake duties for the agency.&#xA0; This ensures the numbers of credentials are controlled, credentials are revoked when no longer required for operational purposes and that the risk of unauthorised activities and access is minimised.&#xA0;</paragraph><paragraph title="16.4.33.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Must" CID="6852">Agencies MUST establish robust credential suspension and revocation procedures as part of the agency&#x2019;s Privileged Access Management (PAM) policy.</paragraph></block><block title=" Privileged Account, Rights and Credential Inventory"><paragraph title="16.4.34.R.01.">Account and credential &#x201C;sprawl&#x201D; is a continuing challenge as the number of users constantly changes and the number and variety of devices evolves and grows.&#xA0; The growing use of the Internet of Things (IoT) is a good example of this.&#xA0; A primary tool in the management and containment of sprawl is the creation and maintenance of an inventory of privileged accounts and the access rights and credential associated with those accounts together with a process of continuous discovery.&#xA0;

Cryptographic Fundamentals"><subsection title="Objective"><paragraph title="17.1.1.">Cryptographic products, algorithms and protocols are approved by the GCSB for suitability before being used and that cryptographic implementations by agencies are adequate for the&#xA0;protection of data and communications.</paragraph></subsection><subsection title="Context"><block title="Scope"><paragraph title="17.1.2.">This section covers information on the fundamentals of cryptography including the use of encryption to protect data at rest and in transit. &#xA0;Detailed information on algorithms and protocols approved to protect classified information can be found in Section 17.2 - Approved Cryptographic Algorithms and Section 17.3 - Approved Cryptographic Protocols.</paragraph></block><block title="Purpose of cryptography"><paragraph title="17.1.3.">Encryption is primarily used to provide confidentiality protecting against the risk of information being exploited by an attacker. More broadly, cryptography can also provide authentication, non-repudiation and integrity. Cryptography is also used in the establishment of secure connectivity, such as IPSEC VPNs.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.4.">The use of approved encryption will generally reduce the likelihood of an unauthorised party gaining access to the information contained within the encrypted data.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.5.">Cryptography is an important control for data protection and the encryption selected will depend on the classification of the data. &#xA0;Note that classification, in itself, provides no protection but is merely indicative of the degree of protection and care in handling required for that level of classification.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.6.">Care needs to be taken with encryption systems that do not encrypt the entire media content to ensure that either all of the classified data is encrypted or that the media is handled in accordance with the highest classification of the unencrypted data.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.7.">With the increases in speed and computing power and the cost reductions of modern computing, older cryptographic algorithms are increasingly vulnerable. &#xA0;It is vital that recommendations and controls in the NZISM are followed.</paragraph></block><block title="Using encryption"><paragraph title="17.1.8.">Encryption of data at rest can be used to reduce the physical protection of storage and handling requirements of the media or systems.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.9.">Encryption of data in transit can be used to provide protection for information being communicated over insecure mediums and hence reduce the security requirements of the communication process.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.10.">When agencies use encryption for data at rest or in transit, they are not reducing the classification of the information. &#xA0;When encryption is used the potential risk of disclosure of the information is reduced, and as such the protection requirements for a lower classification may be&#xA0;considered to be more appropriate to that information.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.11.">As the classification of the information does not change when encrypted, agencies cannot use the lowered storage, physical transfer or security requirements as a baseline to further lower requirements with an additional cryptographic product.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.12.">In general terms, the level of assurance of specific&#xA0;encryption protocols and algorithms&#xA0;is defined in terms of Common Criteria, Protection Profiles or, in some cases, approved cryptographic evaluations. &#xA0;It is important to note that evaluations of cryptographic protocols and algorithms are NOT universally conducted when security products are evaluated, relying rather on previous approved evaluations of cryptographic protocols and algorithms.</paragraph></block><block title="Risk Assessments"><paragraph title="17.1.13.">Encryption algorithms create data transformations that are designed to be difficult to easily reverse by unauthorised users.&#xA0; Today&#x2019;s software will usually provide several algorithmic options, including some older algorithms provided for backward compatibility with older (legacy) systems.&#xA0; In many cases the older algorithms may be deprecated, are considered time-expired and are not fit for purpose in modern systems.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.14.">In all cases a comprehensive risk assessment should be undertaken before configurations are selected.&#xA0; Some general principles to be considered are:

Multi-Factor Authentication"><subsection title="Objective"><paragraph title="16.7.1.">To ensure authentication systems incorporate Multi-Factor Authentication mechanisms to secure Privileged Accounts and in accordance with the Agency&#x2019;s Privileged Access Management (PAM) policy.</paragraph></subsection><subsection title="Context"><block title="Scope"><paragraph title="16.7.2.">This section provides information and guidance on the establishment and operation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).&#xA0; It is a critical component of robust Identity and Access Management (IAM), particularly where remote access workforces are required or exist.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.7.3.">Reference to other chapters and sections in this document is essential.&#xA0; In particular:

> Section 9.1 &#x2013; Information Security Awareness and Training ;
> Section 16.1 &#x2013; Identification, Authentication and Passwords;

> Section 16.4 &#x2013; Privileged Access Management; and
> Chapter 17 - Cryptography.
> </paragraph></block><block title="Background"><paragraph title="16.7.4.">Authentication is a key element of security that provides confirmation of the identity of all parties to a transaction.&#xA0; In this context a transaction may include browsing, financial operations and all types of data access, creation, copying and deletion.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.7.5.">Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is a security system that verifies a user&#x2019;s identity by requiring multiple credentials, which may be of the same factor or type.&#xA0; Initial authentication often requires a username and password followed by a requirement for other (additional) credentials.&#xA0; It is important to recognise that MFA authentication is not necessarily the same as Two-Factor Authentication or Dual-Factor Authentication. &#xA0;MFA can enable, for example, valid users&#x2019; access to permit credential reset, even if they are using a username and password that may have been compromised.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.7.6.">Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is a strong defence and deterrent against many credential attacks, including brute-force, credential stuffing and password spraying attacks.&#xA0; It also defends against social engineering attacks seeking user credentials.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.7.7.">Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) incorporates Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), which is also briefly discussed in Section 16.1 &#x2013; Identification, Authentication and Passwords.&#xA0; 2FA requires two elements from any of the three factors of authentication and with the second factor from a different group to the first factor selected.&#xA0; These factors or groups are:
> Something you have (preferably NOT the device itself but a SEPARATE authentication device such as a token, RFID card or smartcard).&#xA0; This is also known as the possession or ownership factor;
> Something you know such as a PIN, One-Time Password (OTP), reusable password, pattern or other component of a standard authentication mechanism.&#xA0; This is also described as the knowledge factor;
> Something you are (physical characteristics or biometrics of various types).&#xA0; This is also described as the inherence factor.
> </paragraph><paragraph title="16.7.8.">MFA is frequently used where the assurance provided by username and password is inadequate.&#xA0; Additional authenticators increase attack resistance and reduce risk of unauthorised access. Additional authentication also assists in managing Privileged Access (refer to Section 16.4 &#x2013; Privileged Access Management).</paragraph><paragraph title="16.7.9.">MFA is most effective when knowledge, possession, and inherence authentication factors are used as compensating factors for other authentication weaknesses.&#xA0; This is discussed in more detail in 16.7.16 below.&#xA0; Using MFA increases attack resistance by increasing the difficulty of obtaining all necessary authenticators.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.7.10.">It is important to use a variety of factors to strengthen attack resistance in order to increase confidence levels in the chosen authentication system.&#xA0; For example, using a second factor from the knowledge group is less effective as passwords are inherently part of the knowledge group.&#xA0; Knowledge groups are most exposed to attack and compromise through social engineering.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.7.11.">To maximise the effectiveness and security of any Multi-Factor Authentication construct, the authentication service should be dedicated, hardened and isolated within the network&#x2019;s security architecture.</paragraph></block><block title="SMS"><paragraph title="16.7.12.">There are several known vulnerabilities in SMS which may make it unsuitable and unsafe for authentication purposes.&#xA0; Vulnerabilities include:
> Hackers have been able to mislead and persuade carriers and service providers into porting a phone number to a new device through a SIM swap.&#xA0; This can often be achieved with minimal personal information such as your phone number, date of birth, full name, the last four digits of your bank card access number, bank account number, mobile device number, Social Security number or similar information.&#xA0; Users often store bank cards with their mobile device so if the device is stolen or simply accessed temporarily, this data can also be accessed.&#xA0; Once the phone number has been redirected, physical access to your device is no longer required.&#xA0; Any SMS codes are then subject to compromise.
> If text messages are synched with or duplicated on a laptop, tablet or other personal device, then SMS are vulnerable if the device used by another person or if the device is stolen.
> There are vulnerabilities in mobile telecommunication infrastructure in what's described as a SS7 (Signalling System 7) attack.&#xA0; An SS7 attack is an exploit that takes advantage of a weakness in the design of SS7 which can enable data theft, eavesdropping, text interception and location tracking.&#xA0; SS7 is a protocol dating from the mid-1970&#x2019;s and almost all telecommunication service providers have now implemented security measures to counter SS7 exploits.&#xA0; Social engineering remains a risk.
> </paragraph></block><block title="Key Benefits"><paragraph title="16.7.13.">The principal benefits of MFA include:
> Strengthened security and credential protection;
> Streamlined user access;
> Reduced administrative overhead;
> Increased security visibility; and
> Improved compliance.
> </paragraph></block><block title="Adaptive Authentication"><paragraph title="16.7.14.">Adaptive Authentication varies the level or degree of authentication required where an unusual authentication request occurs.&#xA0; For example, out of normal hours, from an unusual geolocation, from an unrecognised device, from an unrecognised IP address and so on.&#xA0; When an unusual authentication request is received, Adaptive Authentication may request additional credentials such as a one-time code provided to a known mobile phone number. &#xA0;Some risk factors that may trigger Adaptive Authentication include:
> The location of the access request such as such as a caf&#xE9;, airport or home;
> The time of the access request such as like late at night, over weekends or during normal working hours;
> The type of device, such as a smartphone, tablet, laptop or unrecognised device;
> The type of connection, for example, a public network such as the internet, or a VPN or some other private network; and
> A request for access to privileged accounts.
> &#xA0;</paragraph><paragraph title="16.7.15.">Adaptive authentication includes what is sometimes described as transaction identification where known characteristics are compared to the transaction or access request.&#xA0; For example a known location or common access request.&#xA0; If known characteristics do not match then additional authentication steps may be indicated or required.</paragraph></block><block title="Client-Side Authentication"><paragraph title="16.7.16.">Client-side authentication originates from the user&#x2019;s device such as laptop, mobile phone, tablet or home computer.&#xA0; These devices may provide a variety of authentication methods including:
> Inherence factor/Biometric:
> 
> Fingerprint scans;
> Facial recognition;
> Voice command/recognition;
> Iris scans;
> Keystroke dynamics;
> 
> 
> Knowledge factor:
> 
> PIN codes;
> Pattern codes;
> 
> 
> Possession factor:
> 
> Geofencing;
> Bluetooth device proximity/Near field communication (NFC).
> 
> 
> </paragraph><paragraph title="16.7.17.">It is important to note that some biometric and other measures, for example fingerprints, are susceptible to attacks such as spoofing.&#xA0; To combat these biometric attacks secondary measures are also required, for example pulse-sensing in addition to fingerprint detection in order to ensure the fingerprint presentation is a live person. &#xA0;Clearly not all secondary measures are fully effective in themselves and multiple secondary measures may be required for high risk/high value authorisation requests.</paragraph></block><block title="Single-User and Multi-User Authorisation"><paragraph title="16.7.18.">Single-User authorisationinvolves prompting the account holder to authorise an action being taken on his behalf.&#xA0; For example, single-user authorisation can even prevent fraud as it occurs in a user-friendly manner.&#xA0; Instead of calling the customer to verify the legitimacy of a purchase, credit card companies could request customer authentication for an on-line purchase by sending an authorisation request to the customer through an alternate channel such as a mobile phone.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.7.19.">Multi-User authorisation usually requires multiple and separate authentications (usually people) in order to authorise a transaction or event, such as establishing an account.&#xA0; This system supports the &#x201C;separation of duties&#x201D; concept common in accounting transactions or other high risk activities.&#xA0; Another example is a password change for a privileged account.&#xA0; Multiuser authorisation may also assess risk indicators and context (e.g. time, location) to select the authentication components and requirements.</paragraph></block><block title="Multi-Step Authentication"><paragraph title="16.7.20.">Multi-step Authentication is a design and architectural approach to control access to resources by sequentially using multiple authentication verifiers. &#xA0;Each authentication step grants access to increasingly privileged areas of the system until access to the desired resources is reached (refer also to 16.4 &#x2013; Privileged Access Management). &#xA0;Multi-Step Authentication can be activated by risk-based &#x201C;triggers&#x201D; where risk factors are identified.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.7.21.">Multi-step Authentication may require only one authentication factor or mechanism, so it is important not to confuse Multi-Step Authentication with Multi-Factor Authentication.&#xA0; Multi-Step Authentication may not be as secure as MFA and cannot be an appropriate substitute for MFA.&#xA0; A key risk is repeated use of a single authentication factor.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.7.22.">It is also worth noting, however, that Multi-Step combined with Multi-Factor Authentication is a strong architectural security construct, particularly when separate authentication factors are required at each step when accessing privileged accounts.</paragraph></block><block title="Perfect Forward Secrecy"><paragraph title="16.7.23.">In addition to the encryption protocols and algorithms discussed in Chapter 17 - Cryptography, the concept of Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS), often simplified to Forward Secrecy, should also be incorporated into any authentication mechanism design.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.7.24.">Forward Secrecy is a property of secure communication protocols that is intended to prevent a compromised encryption key from being used to decrypt previously encrypted traffic. &#xA0;Clearly a compromised key must be immediately replaced in order to maintain the integrity of communications.&#xA0; This mechanism is described as a &#x201C;rolling secrets&#x201D; technique and is designed to prevent device spoofing and the cloning of mobile clients.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.7.25.">A &#x201C;rolling secret&#x201D; key is located on the client device.&#xA0; The client receives two encrypted packages.&#xA0; The first contains another private key and is decrypted by the current private key held on the client device.&#xA0; The new key is used to decrypt the second package and the new private key replaces the existing private key, which is then discarded.&#xA0; The new key is used to encrypt traffic to the authentication server.&#xA0; With each cycle the client replaces the old key with the new key.</paragraph></block><block title="Cryptography"><paragraph title="16.7.26.">The use of encryption is a fundamental component is the security of a Multi-Factor Authentication mechanism.&#xA0; It is essential that only approved cryptographic protocols and algorithms are used, refer to Chapter 17 &#x2013; Cryptography.</paragraph></block><block title="Risk Analysis"><paragraph title="16.7.27.">The design of Multi-Factor Authentication should start with a risk review in order to identify any existing and new risks from changing environments, user populations and threat landscapes.&#xA0; Some early steps will include:
> Review business drivers, existing identity infrastructure, enterprise applications, core platform infrastructure and development plans for each of these;
> Ensure any plans for cloud and related services are reviewed and incorporated;
> Identify authentication use cases including employees and contractors, consumers, customers, partners, and suppliers.&#xA0; For Digital Government this may also include the General Public for some systems;
> Develop baseline requirements;
> Undertake a threat analysis for each use case; and
> Select control mechanisms to manage identified risks.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.7.28.">This risk analysis will inform and direct the development of an authentication architecture to provide robust but usable security for each use case.&#xA0; Some key questions include:
> How will users access the system or application?
> At what stage will users be authenticated?
> What authentication factors will provide the appropriate level of authentication and security?
> Is the level of authentication appropriate to secure and protect the systems, data and other related assets? and
> Is there sufficient capacity to service anticipated workloads?
> </paragraph></block><block title="Governance and Control"><paragraph title="16.7.29.">Good governance processes assist in identifying potential risks to your systems, data, employees, partners and contractors and reduces the risk of a breach or failure to comply with legislation and regulation.&#xA0; Good governance processes support the fulfilment of fiduciary duties of senior and executive management.</paragraph><paragraph title="16.7.30.">Technology governance must demonstrate effective control, security, effectiveness and clear accountability.&#xA0; Identity Access Management and Authentication are fundamental components in protecting agency systems, data and technology assets and underpinning technology governance structures.&#xA0;</paragraph><paragraph title="16.7.31.">There are also a number of national and international legislative and regulatory requirements and accepted international standards which may influence aspects of governance, particularly in relation to data protection and privacy.&#xA0; While not an exhaustive list, these include:
> New Zealand&#x2019;s Privacy Act;
> New Zealand&#x2019;s Public Records Act;
> The European Union&#x2019;s Payment Services Directive (PSD);
> The EU&#x2019;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR);

Of particular note is the requirement to encrypt RESTRICTED/SENSITIVE data when in transit over public systems, including any Internet connection, public network or any other network NOT directly controlled by the agency.</paragraph></block><block title="Encryption and Key Management"><paragraph title="17.1.33.">Encryption is necessary to protect the information while in transit and while NOT under the direct control of the agency.&#xA0; The use of encryption (also including data encryption, use of a VPN or some other form of protection using cryptography) must also consider cryptographic key management and the retention of control of key management.&#xA0; Where cloud services are used it is essential that the protection of data at rest is also considered.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.34.">Where agencies make use of VPN/ MPLS services provided by an ISP, Telco or other service provider, the control and management of the cryptographic key is fundamental to the integrity and security of the encrypted data.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.35.">If your encryption keys are compromised, then any authentication and encryption mechanisms, no matter how robust or comprehensive, are futile.&#xA0; Further risks include the loss of access to encrypted data and the potential to expose all data and systems if keys are maliciously or accidentally replaced.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.36.">The selection of the cryptographic protocol and algorithm is described in the NZISM, Chapter 17 and specified in 17.1.48.C.02. It is essential that agencies select and use only approved cryptographic algorithms and protocols and apply the cryptographic key management requirements of the NZISM, see section 17.9 - Key Management.</paragraph></block><block title="Direct Control / Agency Control"><paragraph title="17.1.37.">In relation to the NZISM, Direct Control is the immediate and continuous physical and logical control, responsibility for, protection and operation of agency information systems and data.&#xA0; In the NZISM, Agency Control is synonymous with Direct Control.</paragraph></block><block title="Non-Agency Control"><paragraph title="17.1.38.">Where agencies outsource the management of data centres it follows that they do NOT have direct control over the data centre and related gateways.&#xA0; In other cases the operation of systems within an agency are also outsourced.&#xA0; In such cases encryption MUST be applied at the transmitting device as this is the logical point at which direct agency control ceases.&#xA0; In large agencies, this is likely to be impractical and creates a significant key management overhead.&#xA0; Encryption for routine traffic originating at the transmitting device is therefore likely to occur only in exceptional cases or where special protection is required.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.39.">The determination of when and where a communication/transmission leaves direct agency control will depend on a number of factors including:
> The scope and extent of outsourcing and information systems support agreements with service providers;
> Service agreements with ISP&#x2019;s, Telcos and other communication service providers;
> The agency&#x2019;s system architecture and security architecture.&#xA0; In particular the boundary where direct agency control ceases.&#xA0; In traditional network architectures this was described as the &#x201C;gateway&#x201D;;
> Key management and control of the application of keys when encrypting/decrypting;
> The use of Hardware Security Modules (HSM&#x2019;s- refer to section 17.10).

> The encryption algorithm and protocol used;
> Cryptographic key length;
> The authentication protocol
> Key Exchange protocol;
> Selection of VPN protocol;
> VPN monitoring and &#x201C;kill switch&#x201D; to deter IP leakage&#xA0;&#xA0; and snooping;
> Cryptographic key management.
> </paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.42.">It is important to understand that a variety of VPN services can use a variety of mechanisms.&#xA0; Agencies should also consider the service provider&#x2019;s use of hash authentication, perfect forward secrecy, and the difference in encryption settings on both the data and control channels.&#xA0; The NZISM specifies the cryptographic protocols and cryptographic algorithms that should be used (see sections 17.2 &#x2013; Approved Cryptographic Algorithms and 17.3 &#x2013; Approved Cryptographic Protocols) and agencies must ensure the VPN connection conforms with these requirements.</paragraph></block></subsection><subsection title="References"><paragraph title="17.1.43.">Further references can be found at:
