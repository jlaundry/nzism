           Key stretching is a technique of slowing the hash function as a means of discouraging attacks (making the time spent not worthwhile while increasing the length of the detection window).  Typically this is achieved through a high iteration count in the hashing process, in some cases as high as 10,000 iterations.  It is important to note the stretching of the key does not alter the entropy (randomness) of the key-space, rather it complicates the method of computing the stretched key.However note the time versus security trade-off here as key stretching comes at the cost of more time spent in validating user connection requests.

           Sharing passwords and UserIDs (credentials) may be convenient but invariably hampers efforts to identify a specific user and attribute actions to a specific person or system. While agencies and users find convenience in sharing credentials, doing so is highly risky. Shared credentials can defeat accountability and the attribution and non-repudiation principles of access control. This is particularly important where administrative access to networks and servers or access to classified information is provided through shared credentials.

 Interactive attempts including password guessing, brute force attacks or some knowledge of the user or agency.
 Obtaining the password through social engineering or phishing.
 Compromising the password through oversight, observation, use of keyloggers, cameras etc.
 Cracking through network traffic interception, misconfiguration, malware, data capture etc. For example a simple eight-letter password can today be brute-forced in minutes by software freely available on the Internet.

+          The characteristics and capability of privileged accounts are described at 16.3.3.  It is important to note that systems themselves, as well as human users, may have privileged account access.  As such it is important to clearly and individually identify all real persons, systems and devices with privileged account access.

+          A Privileged Account is a user account with high levels of access to systems, devices and data.  Privileged accounts may, for example, be able to install or remove software, delete data, upgrade operating systems, or modify system or application configurations.  They may also have access to data that is not normally accessible to standard users.

-          Cryptography is used to provide confidentiality and preserve integrity of data transmitted over networks where it may be intercepted or examined and is outside the control of the sender and recipient.
+          Privileged Accounts invariably have direct or indirect access to most or all IT assets of an agency or organisation.  When used improperly or maliciously, privileged accounts represent a significant security threat to operations, often exposing sensitive data, impeding operations or damaging IT systems.  Any compromise of these accounts is, therefore, a significant business, operational and reputational risk.

+          There are many types of privileged access including:
+Root, Domain and other Administrator accounts are typically used for installing, updating and removing software, changing configurations and administering system passwords.
+Service Accounts, which may include local or domain accounts, are typically used for running processes, such as web servers, database servers, and application servers.  These may also include the ability to change passwords.
+Emergency Accounts, sometimes referred to as “DRP”, “firecall” or “breakglass” accounts.  While access to emergency accounts normally requires managerial approval as a security measure, they are typically an inefficient manual process with limited auditability.
+System or Application Accounts are characteristically used by devices and systems for running operating system components and owning related files.

+          <paragraph title="16.4.17.">
+          Privileged Accounts are frequently used to deploy and maintain IT systems and necessarily exist in nearly every connected device, server, database, and application.  Privileged Accounts may extend beyond an agency-controlled IT infrastructure to include, for example, employee-managed corporate social media accounts.  Most agencies and other organisations can typically have many more privileged accounts than employees, sometimes as many as two or three times the number of employees.  It is not unusual for some privileged accounts to be unidentified, overlooked, unmanaged, and therefore unprotected.
+          </paragraph>
+          <paragraph title="16.4.18.">
+          Governance ensures that privileged accounts are properly approved, controlled, monitored and decommissioned throughout their entire lifecycle.  A PAM Policy defines the roles, policies and mechanisms for access requests, as well as the workflow for privileged access approvals and delivery.  Monitoring and auditing ensure that account permissions and usage remain appropriate over time.  PAM governance is a fundamental part of IT Governance as it can influence other IT security systems, such as identity and access management systems.
+          </paragraph>
+          <paragraph title="16.4.19.">
+          In order to support strong IT Governance, it is vital that security efforts are coordinated and technology investment managed.  This includes the integration of PAM into the Information Security Policy, Systems Architecture, IT Security Strategy and Risk Management Plan. The sensitivity of data and operations should be assessed by undertaking an impact assessment.
+          </paragraph>
+          <paragraph title="16.4.20.">
+          Underpinning any PAM is the principle of enforcement of least privilege.  This is defined as the minimisation of access rights and permissions for users, accounts, applications, systems, devices and computing processes to the absolute minimum necessary in order to perform routine, authorised activities and maintain the safe and secure operation of agency or organisational systems.
+          </paragraph>
+          <paragraph title="16.4.21.">
+          Enforcing the principle of least privilege assists agencies in minimising their systems attack surface, supporting audit and compliance though improved visibility.  This also can reduce risk, complexity, and costs for agencies.
+          </paragraph>
+          <paragraph title="16.4.22.">
+          Provision of unnecessary system privileges or data access rights will magnify the impact of misuse or compromise of that users account and can even be devastating.  Account privileges should be established to provide a reasonable but minimal level of system privileges and rights needed in order to support the purpose and role.  The granting of elevated or excessive system privileges should be carefully controlled and managed.
+          </paragraph>
+          <paragraph title="16.4.23.">
+          Risks associated with access to privileged accounts include:
+Misuse of privileges;
+Increased attacker capability;
+Circumventing established security and oversight controls;
+Severe system disruption or failure; and
+Significant data compromise and/or loss.
+          </paragraph>
+          <paragraph title="16.4.24.">
+          The principles of PAM controls are to:
+Establish and maintain an inventory of privileged accounts;
+Assess the risk(s) of each privileged access channel;
+Enforce the principle of least privilege;
+Use two-factor or Multi-Factor Authentication for access to Privileged Accounts;
+Minimise access to only essential activities;
+Minimise the number of privileged access channels;
+Ensure each channel and user can be uniquely identified (prevent or minimise sharing of credentials, particularly with accounts such as “root” or “admin”);
+Ensure operational systems have access to compiled code only;
+Ensure source code is created, managed and stored on non-operational systems only;
+Restrict access to source code (deny-by-default);
+Log all access to source code including the detection, evaluation, recording and termination of privileged access channels;
+Ensure all logs are periodically reviewed;
+Ensure strong and strict change control procedures are implemented;
+Ensure the authorisation, activation and deactivation of privileged access channels is strictly enforced; and
+Regularly audit and review PAM controls.
+          </paragraph>
+          <paragraph title="16.4.25.">
+          It is also important to define all privileged accounts used by an agency or by other organisations, particularly where outsource arrangements are in place.  It is fundamental for robust security to identify and record the business functions, related data, systems and access privileges.  This is particularly important for agencies that create, store and process classified data.
+          </paragraph>
+          <paragraph title="16.4.26.">
+          Without a comprehensive privileged accounts inventory, agencies and other organisations may overlook “backdoor” accounts which allow users to bypass proper controls and auditing.  These may have been created during system development, by malicious insiders or by external attackers.  Such unregistered accounts may be undetected for months or even years and can create a means of unauthorised and unmonitored access.  Such accounts may also be used to erase activity logs to avoid detection.
+          </paragraph>
+          <paragraph title="16.4.27.">
+          A privileged access inventory should include a description of the IT system, information asset, privilege description, users and risk classification.  This is essential information for assessing risk, the determining of controls and for identifying and managing use and misuse.  Of note are:
+Local or Domain Server Admin accounts;
+Domain Admin accounts that typically control Active Directory users;
+System Admin accounts that manage databases;
+Root accounts that manage Unix/Linux platforms;
+Accounts that run and manage Windows applications, services, and scheduled tasks;

+          Adaptive Authentication varies the level or degree of authentication required where an unusual authentication request occurs.  For example, out of normal hours, from an unusual geolocation, from an unrecognised device, from an unrecognised IP address and so on.  When an unusual authentication request is received, Adaptive Authentication may request additional credentials such as a one-time code provided to a known mobile phone number.  Some risk factors that may trigger Adaptive Authentication include:
+The location of the access request such as such as a café, airport or home;
+The time of the access request such as like late at night, over weekends or during normal working hours;
+The type of device, such as a smartphone, tablet, laptop or unrecognised device;
+The type of connection, for example, a public network such as the internet, or a VPN or some other private network; and
+A request for access to privileged accounts.
+          </paragraph>
+          <paragraph title="16.7.15.">
+          Adaptive authentication includes what is sometimes described as transaction identification where known characteristics are compared to the transaction or access request.  For example a known location or common access request.  If known characteristics do not match then additional authentication steps may be indicated or required.
+          </paragraph>

+        <block title="Background">
+          <paragraph title="16.7.10.">
+          It is important to use a variety of factors to strengthen attack resistance in order to increase confidence levels in the chosen authentication system.  For example, using a second factor from the knowledge group is less effective as passwords are inherently part of the knowledge group.  Knowledge groups are most exposed to attack and compromise through social engineering.
+          </paragraph>
+          <paragraph title="16.7.11.">
+          To maximise the effectiveness and security of any Multi-Factor Authentication construct, the authentication service should be dedicated, hardened and isolated within the network’s security architecture.
+          </paragraph>
+          <paragraph title="16.7.4.">
+          Authentication is a key element of security that provides confirmation of the identity of all parties to a transaction.  In this context a transaction may include browsing, financial operations and all types of data access, creation, copying and deletion.
+          </paragraph>
+          <paragraph title="16.7.5.">
+          Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is a security system that verifies a user’s identity by requiring multiple credentials, which may be of the same factor or type.  Initial authentication often requires a username and password followed by a requirement for other (additional) credentials.  It is important to recognise that MFA authentication is not necessarily the same as Two-Factor Authentication or Dual-Factor Authentication.  MFA can enable, for example, valid users’ access to permit credential reset, even if they are using a username and password that may have been compromised.
+          </paragraph>
+          <paragraph title="16.7.6.">
+          Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is a strong defence and deterrent against many credential attacks, including brute-force, credential stuffing and password spraying attacks.  It also defends against social engineering attacks seeking user credentials.
+          </paragraph>
+          <paragraph title="16.7.7.">
+          Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) incorporates Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), which is also briefly discussed in Section 16.1 – Identification, Authentication and Passwords.  2FA requires two elements from any of the three factors of authentication and with the second factor from a different group to the first factor selected.  These factors or groups are:
+Something you have (preferably NOT the device itself but a SEPARATE authentication device such as a token, RFID card or smartcard).  This is also known as the possession or ownership factor;
+Something you know such as a PIN, One-Time Password (OTP), reusable password, pattern or other component of a standard authentication mechanism.  This is also described as the knowledge factor;
+Something you are (physical characteristics or biometrics of various types).  This is also described as the inherence factor.
+          </paragraph>
+          <paragraph title="16.7.8.">
+          MFA is frequently used where the assurance provided by username and password is inadequate.  Additional authenticators increase attack resistance and reduce risk of unauthorised access. Additional authentication also assists in managing Privileged Access (refer to Section 16.4 – Privileged Access Management).
+          </paragraph>
+          <paragraph title="16.7.9.">
+          MFA is most effective when knowledge, possession, and inherence authentication factors are used as compensating factors for other authentication weaknesses.  This is discussed in more detail in 16.7.16 below.  Using MFA increases attack resistance by increasing the difficulty of obtaining all necessary authenticators.

+          Client-side authentication originates from the user’s device such as laptop, mobile phone, tablet or home computer.  These devices may provide a variety of authentication methods including:
+Inherence factor/Biometric:
+
+Fingerprint scans;
+Facial recognition;
+Voice command/recognition;
+Iris scans;

+          It is important to note that some biometric and other measures, for example fingerprints, are susceptible to attacks such as spoofing.  To combat these biometric attacks secondary measures are also required, for example pulse-sensing in addition to fingerprint detection in order to ensure the fingerprint presentation is a live person.  Clearly not all secondary measures are fully effective in themselves and multiple secondary measures may be required for high risk/high value authorisation requests.

+          Multi-step Authentication is a design and architectural approach to control access to resources by sequentially using multiple authentication verifiers.  Each authentication step grants access to increasingly privileged areas of the system until access to the desired resources is reached (refer also to 16.4 – Privileged Access Management).  Multi-Step Authentication can be activated by risk-based “triggers” where risk factors are identified.
+          </paragraph>
+          <paragraph title="16.7.21.">
+          Multi-step Authentication may require only one authentication factor or mechanism, so it is important not to confuse Multi-Step Authentication with Multi-Factor Authentication.  Multi-Step Authentication may not be as secure as MFA and cannot be an appropriate substitute for MFA.  A key risk is repeated use of a single authentication factor.
+          </paragraph>

+          </paragraph>
+          <paragraph title="16.7.24.">
+          Forward Secrecy is a property of secure communication protocols that is intended to prevent a compromised encryption key from being used to decrypt previously encrypted traffic.  Clearly a compromised key must be immediately replaced in order to maintain the integrity of communications.  This mechanism is described as a “rolling secrets” technique and is designed to prevent device spoofing and the cloning of mobile clients.
+          </paragraph>
+          <paragraph title="16.7.25.">
+          A “rolling secret” key is located on the client device.  The client receives two encrypted packages.  The first contains another private key and is decrypted by the current private key held on the client device.  The new key is used to decrypt the second package and the new private key replaces the existing private key, which is then discarded.  The new key is used to encrypt traffic to the authentication server.  With each cycle the client replaces the old key with the new key.

+          <paragraph title="16.7.27.">
+          The design of Multi-Factor Authentication should start with a risk review in order to identify any existing and new risks from changing environments, user populations and threat landscapes.  Some early steps will include:
+Review business drivers, existing identity infrastructure, enterprise applications, core platform infrastructure and development plans for each of these;
+Ensure any plans for cloud and related services are reviewed and incorporated;
+Identify authentication use cases including employees and contractors, consumers, customers, partners, and suppliers.  For Digital Government this may also include the General Public for some systems;
+Develop baseline requirements;
+Undertake a threat analysis for each use case; and
+Select control mechanisms to manage identified risks.

+          <paragraph title="16.7.28.">
+          This risk analysis will inform and direct the development of an authentication architecture to provide robust but usable security for each use case.  Some key questions include:
+How will users access the system or application?
+At what stage will users be authenticated?
+What authentication factors will provide the appropriate level of authentication and security?
+Is the level of authentication appropriate to secure and protect the systems, data and other related assets? and

+          <paragraph title="16.7.12.">
+          There are several known vulnerabilities in SMS which may make it unsuitable and unsafe for authentication purposes.  Vulnerabilities include:
+Hackers have been able to mislead and persuade carriers and service providers into porting a phone number to a new device through a SIM swap.  This can often be achieved with minimal personal information such as your phone number, date of birth, full name, the last four digits of your bank card access number, bank account number, mobile device number, Social Security number or similar information.  Users often store bank cards with their mobile device so if the device is stolen or simply accessed temporarily, this data can also be accessed.  Once the phone number has been redirected, physical access to your device is no longer required.  Any SMS codes are then subject to compromise.
+If text messages are synched with or duplicated on a laptop, tablet or other personal device, then SMS are vulnerable if the device used by another person or if the device is stolen.
+There are vulnerabilities in mobile telecommunication infrastructure in what's described as a SS7 (Signalling System 7) attack.  An SS7 attack is an exploit that takes advantage of a weakness in the design of SS7 which can enable data theft, eavesdropping, text interception and location tracking.  SS7 is a protocol dating from the mid-1970’s and almost all telecommunication service providers have now implemented security measures to counter SS7 exploits.  Social engineering remains a risk.
