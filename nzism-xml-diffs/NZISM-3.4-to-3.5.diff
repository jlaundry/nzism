Penetration testing is also very useful in validating the effectiveness of the defensive mechanisms.

It also demonstrates prudent risk management.</paragraph><paragraph title="4.1.27.">A penetration test usually involves the use of intrusive methods or attacks conducted by trusted individuals, methods similar to those used by intruders or hackers. Care must be taken not to adversely affect normal operations while these tests are conducted.</paragraph><paragraph title="4.1.28.">Organisations may conduct their own tests and regular simple tests are effective in maintaining the organisation&#x2019;s security posture. Because of the level of expertise required to effectively conduct more complex testing, comprehensive penetration tests are often outsourced to specialist organisations.</paragraph><paragraph title="4.1.29.">Penetration tests can range from simple scans of IP addresses in order to identify devices or systems offering services with known vulnerabilities, to exploiting known vulnerabilities that exist in an unpatched operating system, applications or other software.

This outcome is predominately caused by security risks being insufficiently considered and documented within the SRMP resulting in an inaccurate scoping of security measures within the SecPlan. In such cases the Accreditation Authority may request that the SRMP and SecPlan be amended and security measures reassessed before accreditation is awarded.</paragraph><paragraph title="4.5.14.">In awarding accreditation for a system the Accreditation Authority may choose to define a reduced timeframe before reaccreditation, less than that specified in this manual, or place restrictions on the use of the system which are enforced until reaccreditation or until changes are made to the system within a specified timeframe.</paragraph></block><block title="Exception for undertaking certification"><paragraph title="4.5.15.">In exceptional circumstances the Accreditation Authority may elect not to have a certification conducted on a system before making an accreditation decision. The test to be satisfied in such circumstances is that if the system is not operated immediately it would have a devastating and potentially long lasting effect on the operations of the agency. This exception MUST be formally recorded and accepted.</paragraph><paragraph title="4.5.16.">Certification MUST occur as soon as possible as this is an essential part of the governance and assurance mechanism.</paragraph></block></subsection><subsection title="Rationale &amp; Controls"><block title="4.5.17.

> The sensitivity of information on the agency&#x2019;s systems, including financial data, medical information, proprietary information, customer data or other personally identifiable information (PII).
> Security safeguards that are already in place on the system, such as encryption of data at rest.
> The agency&#x2019;s ability to segment its network or otherwise segregate sensitive information stored on its systems.

> </paragraph></block><block title="Agencies must expect vulnerabilities"><paragraph title="5.9.5.">Invariably all software, operating systems and applications have the potential to house exploitable vulnerabilities.&#xA0; Many vulnerabilities are identified by users and other third parties. Some vulnerabilities may be undiscovered or inherent in the application or software.&#xA0; Others may be introduced during upgrades, patches, configuration or other changes.&#xA0;</paragraph><paragraph title="5.9.6.">It is essential that agencies establish a policy and processes to identify and remediate such vulnerabilities.</paragraph></block><block title="Agencies must establish a vulnerability reporting mechanism"><paragraph title="5.9.7.">Published VDPs demonstrate that an agency has a mature and constructive approach when they receive a vulnerability report and also demonstrates openness and transparency in the management of agency systems.</paragraph><paragraph title="5.9.8.">Agencies should establish a process to allow any user (whether a member of the public, business partners, other agencies or agency staff), to report potential vulnerabilities.&#xA0; Any such reporting is on a &#x201C;no blame&#x201D; basis, without fear of repercussion or penalty, provided the agency&#x2019;s disclosure policy is followed and no illegal activity is undertaken.</paragraph><paragraph title="5.9.9.">The VDP must clearly state the conditions under which reports are received.&#xA0; In general terms this also includes a &#x201C;no bug bounty&#x201D; clause as well as limits on web site, system or application probing.</paragraph><paragraph title="5.9.10.">An agency&#x2019;s VDP will necessarily reflect that they may not control or own all of the software they use or the maintenance and development of underlying software (such as compilers, programming or scripting languages and so on).&#xA0; The VDP should clearly state that while the agency can receive reports about software, systems or services run on their behalf by third parties, providers or vendors, they may have to work with the reporting party to report the vulnerability to the relevant vendor.</paragraph><paragraph title="5.9.11.">Where specific legislation applies, for example a reported vulnerability may breach the Privacy Act, agencies must adhere to the legislation.&#xA0; This may change how reports are managed and action communicated to the finder or reporter.&#xA0; This does not change the requirement to maintain communication with the reporter/finder.</paragraph></block><block title="Agencies are expected to find and remediate vulnerabilities"><paragraph title="5.9.12.">The Protective Security Requirements places clear expectations on agencies to maintain awareness of vulnerabilities (see mandatory requirement INFOSEC4).</paragraph><paragraph title="5.9.13.">Section 12.4 of the NZISM sets out expectations and controls to ensure security patches are applied in a timely manner.</paragraph><paragraph title="5.9.14.">The disclosure period commonly used by many vendors, manufacturers and government agencies is 90 days.&#xA0; Vulnerabilities will be either patched, mitigated or managed within this period.&#xA0; In some cases earlier notification is provided to allow users to take mitigating actions until a patch or other solution is available.</paragraph><paragraph title="5.9.15.">VDPs are expected to include a timeframe within which patches will be applied or remedial action taken when a vulnerability is reported to the agency.</paragraph></block><block title="Agencies to create a vulnerability reporting point"><paragraph title="5.9.16.">When security risks in agency services are discovered and reported to the agency, it is vital that a robust communication channel is available to receive the report.</paragraph><paragraph title="5.9.17.">This is commonly described as a &#x201C;security.txt&#x201D;.&#xA0; A draft standard has been published (see References below) to help agencies (and other organisations) outline a process for security researchers to securely report security vulnerabilities.</paragraph></block><block title="Vulnerability disclosure policies are a normal part of learning about and patching vulnerabilities"><paragraph title="5.9.18.">Vulnerability disclosure (sometimes also referred to as responsible disclosure or coordinated vulnerability disclosure) is now an internationally accepted practice for technology organisations.&#xA0; The practice of vulnerability disclosure in modern computing dates to the late 1980s.&#xA0; There are related examples (non-computing) which appeared in the mid-1800s when locksmiths exchanged vulnerability information.</paragraph></block><block title="Bug Bounties"><paragraph title="5.9.19.">&#x201C;Bug bounties&#x201D; are a monetary reward to security researchers for the discovery and reporting of software and other information system vulnerabilities to the agency.&#xA0; Bug Bounties are separate to VDPs and should only be covered if the agency has a bug bounty programme in place.</paragraph></block><block title="Vulnerability disclosure policy (VDP) Content"><paragraph title="5.9.20.">A VDP will typically include:
> A scoping statement setting out which systems the policy applies to (e.g. the agency&#x2019;s website and other public-facing systems);
> Details of how finders can contact the agency&#x2019;s security team (including any public keys for encrypting reports);
> Permitted activities;
> Acknowledgement of reports and a response time (typically 60 or 90 days) for corrections, adjustments, or other &#x201C;fixes&#x201D;;
> Reporters/finders agreeing to not share information about the vulnerability until the end of the disclosure period, to let the organisation fix the issues before it becomes public;
> Illegal activities are not permitted (specifying any relevant legislation, such as the Crimes Act, the Privacy Act etc.); and
> Either a statement that bug bounties will not be paid for any discoveries, or information about the agency&#x2019;s bug bounty programme.

Further information relating to sanitising IT equipment can be found in Section 12.6 - Product Sanitisation and Disposal.</paragraph></block><block title="Definition"><paragraph title="13.4.3.">Sanitisation is defined as the process of removal of data and information from the storage device such that data recovery using any known technique or analysis is prevented or made unfeasible. The process includes the removal of all useful data from the storage device, including metadata, as well as the removal of all labels, markings, classifications and&#xA0;activity logs. Methods vary depending upon the nature, technology used and construction of the storage device or equipment and may include degaussing, incineration, shredding, grinding, knurling or embossing and chemical immersion.</paragraph></block><block title="Sanitising media and IT Equipment "><paragraph title="13.4.4.">The process of sanitisation does not automatically change the classification of the media&#xA0;or IT Equipment, nor does sanitisation necessarily involve the destruction of media&#xA0;or IT Equipment.</paragraph></block><block title="Product selection"><paragraph title="13.4.5.">Agencies are permitted to use non-evaluated products to sanitise media and IT Equipment. However, the product will still need to meet the specifications and achieve the requirements for sanitising media and IT Equipment as outlined in this section.</paragraph></block><block title="Hybrid hard drives, Solid State Drives and Flash Memory Devices"><paragraph title="13.4.6.">Hybrid hard drives, solid state drives and flash memory devices are difficult or impossible to sanitise effectively. In most cases safe disposal will require destruction, this includes any equipment with integrated memory capability. The sanitisation and post sanitisation treatment requirements for redeployment of such devices should be carefully observed.</paragraph></block><block title="New Zealand Eyes Only (NZEO) Materials"><paragraph title="13.4.7.">NZEO endorsed material requires additional protection at every level of classification. In general terms, media and IT Equipment containing NZEO material should be sanitised and redeployed or sanitised and destroyed in accordance with the procedures in this section. Media and IT Equipment that has contained NZEO material must not be disposed of to e-recyclers or sold to any third party.</paragraph></block></subsection><subsection title="References"><paragraph title="13.4.8.">

Further information relating to the destruction of IT equipment can be found in Section 12.6 - Product Sanitisation and Disposal.</paragraph><paragraph title="13.5.3.">Any IT, electrical or electronic equipment MUST be destroyed and disposed of in an environmentally safe and responsible manner.&#xA0; This reflects an increasing responsibility for improved equipment end-of-life treatment and environmentally responsible disposal solutions, while continuing to meet security and data protection requirements.</paragraph></block><block title="Evolution of electronic components and equipment"><paragraph title="13.5.4.">The capability of various types of electronic equipment to store data has increased significantly with technology advances such as solid-state drives (SSDs) and on-board memory devices.&#xA0; In turn these present a rich target of opportunity to, amongst others, cyber-criminals, unauthorised investigators, and foreign intelligence services.&#xA0; Data may include, for example, identity, account numbers, physical addresses, transactions, cryptographic keys, strategic, financial or other private documents, and classified information.</paragraph><paragraph title="13.5.5.">Where data from a discarded device is recovered, it may also result in a privacy or data breach - potentially incurring sanction from data regulators.</paragraph></block><block title="Electronic Waste (Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE))"><paragraph title="13.5.6.">Media and IT equipment can contain a number of elements such as arsenic, lead, mercury, barium, selenium and cadmium in their manufacture.&#xA0; These elements can be poisonous, carcinogenic or toxic in particulate or dust form.&#xA0; If allowed to accumulate in dumps or poorly managed recycling or disposal centres, they can create a serious health risk or environmental hazard.</paragraph><paragraph title="13.5.7.">Lead was traditionally used in solder on printed circuit boards, although it has been banned in many countries in the last decade. Lead oxide may still be found in cathode-ray tubes and older equipment.&#xA0; Lead is toxic to humans and medical research has raised concerns about the impact of low-level exposure on the development of the brain and central nervous system in children.</paragraph><paragraph title="13.5.8.">Other elements used in the manufacture of IT and electronic equipment may include flame retardants and plasticisers, and should be treated with caution.</paragraph><paragraph title="13.5.9.">Some flame-retardant materials used in computers can be toxic if released as dust into the atmosphere.&#xA0; Research has shown that they interfere with brain and skeletal development.</paragraph><paragraph title="13.5.10.">Phthalates are probably best known as plasticisers and are widely used in the electronics industry.&#xA0; One of the most widely used phthalates, DEHP, is classified by the EU as toxic to reproductive health. For example, in 1999 an EU-wide ban was imposed on the use of six phthalates in children's chewable toys.</paragraph></block><block title="Incinerators"><paragraph title="13.5.11.">There are many risks associated with the incineration of electronic waste. Up-to-date guidance is available on the Ministry for the Environment website (see reference table 13.5.21).</paragraph><paragraph title="13.5.12.">Incinerators discharge into the atmosphere and create emissions and ash residue. There is potential for contamination of air, soil and water through the release of pollutants such as hydrocarbons, heavy metals and dioxins.&#xA0;</paragraph><paragraph title="13.5.13.">There are two main by-products of incineration.&#xA0; Firstly, inert bottom ash which is primarily formed from inorganic elements, and secondly, flue gases. These facilities must include gas cleaning systems designed to contain pollutants and safely exhaust to the atmosphere.&#xA0; Properly designed, installed and operated facilities will be able to manage and safely dispose of the waste, particulate matter and contaminants produced by incineration.&#xA0;</paragraph><paragraph title="13.5.14.">It is essential that any incineration facility is properly rated, inspected and authorised or licenced to process WEEE.&#xA0; Any relevant national environmental legislation and regulation must also be complied with.&#xA0; In particular the Resource Management Act and the National Environmental Standards for Air Quality must be observed.</paragraph><paragraph title="13.5.15.">Some electrical and electronic waste materials cannot be safely incinerated.&#xA0; This includes:
> Alkaline batteries;
> Glass;
> Lithium batteries; and
> Mobile phones.

Cryptography"><section title="17.1. Cryptographic Fundamentals"><subsection title="Objective"><paragraph title="17.1.1.">Cryptographic products, algorithms and protocols are approved by the GCSB for suitability before being used and that cryptographic implementations by agencies are adequate for the&#xA0;protection of data and communications.</paragraph></subsection><subsection title="Context"><block title="Scope"><paragraph title="17.1.2.">This section covers information on the fundamentals of cryptography including the use of encryption to protect data at rest and in transit. &#xA0;Detailed information on algorithms and protocols approved to protect classified information can be found in Section 17.2 - Approved Cryptographic Algorithms and Section 17.3 - Approved Cryptographic Protocols.</paragraph></block><block title="Purpose of cryptography"><paragraph title="17.1.3.">Encryption is primarily used to provide confidentiality protecting against the risk of information being exploited by an attacker. More broadly, cryptography can also provide authentication, non-repudiation and integrity. Cryptography is also used in the establishment of secure connectivity, such as IPSEC VPNs.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.4.">The use of approved encryption will generally reduce the likelihood of an unauthorised party gaining access to the information contained within the encrypted data.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.5.">Cryptography is an important control for data protection and the encryption selected will depend on the classification of the data. &#xA0;Note that classification, in itself, provides no protection but is merely indicative of the degree of protection and care in handling required for that level of classification.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.6.">Care needs to be taken with encryption systems that do not encrypt the entire media content to ensure that either all of the classified data is encrypted or that the media is handled in accordance with the highest classification of the unencrypted data.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.7.">With the increases in speed and computing power and the cost reductions of modern computing, older cryptographic algorithms are increasingly vulnerable. &#xA0;It is vital that recommendations and controls in the NZISM are followed.</paragraph></block><block title="Using encryption"><paragraph title="17.1.8.">Encryption of data at rest can be used to reduce the physical protection of storage and handling requirements of the media or systems.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.9.">Encryption of data in transit can be used to provide protection for information being communicated over insecure mediums and hence reduce the security requirements of the communication process.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.10.">When agencies use encryption for data at rest or in transit, they are not reducing the classification of the information. &#xA0;When encryption is used the potential risk of disclosure of the information is reduced, and as such the protection requirements for a lower classification may be&#xA0;considered to be more appropriate to that information.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.11.">As the classification of the information does not change when encrypted, agencies cannot use the lowered storage, physical transfer or security requirements as a baseline to further lower requirements with an additional cryptographic product.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.12.">In general terms, the level of assurance of specific&#xA0;encryption protocols and algorithms&#xA0;is defined in terms of Common Criteria, Protection Profiles or, in some cases, approved cryptographic evaluations. &#xA0;It is important to note that evaluations of cryptographic protocols and algorithms are NOT universally conducted when security products are evaluated, relying rather on previous approved evaluations of cryptographic protocols and algorithms.</paragraph></block><block title="Risk Assessments"><paragraph title="17.1.13.">Encryption algorithms create data transformations that are designed to be difficult to easily reverse by unauthorised users.&#xA0; Today&#x2019;s software will usually provide several algorithmic options, including some older algorithms provided for backward compatibility with older (legacy) systems.&#xA0; In many cases the older algorithms may be deprecated, are considered time-expired and are not fit for purpose in modern systems.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.14.">In all cases a comprehensive risk assessment should be undertaken before configurations are selected.&#xA0; Some general principles to be considered are:
< Long, complex passwords are stronger than short passwords;
< Long keys generally provide stronger encryption than short keys;
< Asymmetric encryption is slower than symmetric encryption;
< Symmetric encryption is generally recommended when the key is stored locally only;
< Asymmetric encryption is recommended when keys need to be shared across communication channels;
< If you are encrypting very large volumes of data, encrypting the data using a symmetric key, and encrypting the symmetric key with an asymmetric key may be more operationally effective;
< Normally encrypted data cannot be compressed, but compressed data can be encrypted.&#xA0; Data should be compressed before encryption.
< Any risk assessment should include consideration of key management - refer to 17.9 Key Management
< </paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.15.">It is important to note that the NZISM prescribes approved algorithms and protocols and users must select combinations from these lists.</paragraph></block><block title="Transitioning Cryptographic Algorithms and Protocols"><paragraph title="17.1.16.">It is important to use algorithms that adequately protect sensitive information.&#xA0; It is also important to recognise that all cryptographic algorithms and protocols have a finite life.&#xA0; Challenges are posed by new cryptanalysis techniques and methods, the increasing power of classical computing technology, and the continuing work on the development of quantum computers.&#xA0; In addition, there is an active field of work that continuously seeks to compromise algorithms and protocols currently in&#xA0;use.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.17.">Planning for changes in the use of cryptography because of algorithm breaks, the availability of more powerful computing techniques or new technologies is an important consideration for agencies.&#xA0; Awareness of retirement or deprecation of algorithms and associated protocols is essential.</paragraph></block><block title="Retiring RSA "><paragraph title="17.1.18.">RSA was announced in 1976 so it is now over 40 years old. Several flaws and attacks have been identified since creation, each of which required specific mitigations, careful implementation and management.&#xA0; Unfortunately there is ample evidence that implementers continue to have difficulties in securely implementing, using and managing RSA.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.19.">To counter identified threats from shorter RSA key lengths, longer key lengths have been specified in the NZISM since 2010.&#xA0; Subsequently it was specified in the NZISM that RSA was approved for use in legacy systems only.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.20.">This approach was selected to allow agencies to plan the retirement of legacy systems and ensure replacement systems were using only approved algorithms and protocols.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.21.">There are several indicators that RSA will be deprecated in the next few years.&#xA0; For example TLS 1.3 deprecates RSA in favour of elliptic curve cryptography.&#xA0; The most recent guidance from NIST is also indicative of impending deprecation of RSA.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.22.">It is, therefore essential that agencies are aware of these changes and plan the retirement of RSA from their systems as part of their ongoing operational management.</paragraph></block><block title="Product specific cryptographic requirements"><paragraph title="17.1.23.">This section provides requirements for the use of cryptography to protect classified information. &#xA0;Requirements, additional to those in this Manual, can exist in consumer guides for products once they have completed an approved evaluation. &#xA0;Vendor specifications supplement this manual and where conflict in controls occurs the product specific requirements take precedence. &#xA0;Any policy or compliance conflicts are to be incorporated into the risk assessment.</paragraph></block><block title="Exceptions for using cryptographic products"><paragraph title="17.1.24.">Where Agencies implement a product that uses an Approved Cryptographic Algorithm or Approved Cryptographic Protocol to provide protection of unclassified data at rest or in transit, that product does not require a separate, approved evaluation. &#xA0;Correct implementation of the cryptographic protocol is fundamental to the proper operation of the Approved Cryptographic Algorithm or Approved Cryptographic Protocol and is part of the checking conducted during system certification.</paragraph></block><block title="Federal Information Processing Standard 140"><paragraph title="17.1.25.">The FIPS 140 is a United States standard for the validation of both hardware and software cryptographic modules.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.26.">FIPS 140 is in its second iteration and is formally referred to as FIPS 140-2. &#xA0;This section refers to the standard as FIPS 140 but applies to both FIPS 140-1 and FIPS 140-2. &#xA0;The third iteration, FIPS 140-3, has been released in draft and this section also applies to that iteration.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.27.">FIPS 140 is not a substitute for an approved evaluation of a product with cryptographic functionality. &#xA0;FIPS 140 is concerned solely with the cryptographic functionality of a module and does not consider any other security functionality.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.28.">Cryptographic evaluations of products will normally be conducted by an approved agency. &#xA0;Where a product&#x2019;s cryptographic functionality has been validated under FIPS 140, the GCSB can, at its discretion, and in consultation with the vendor, reduce the scope of a cryptographic evaluation.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.29.">The GCSB will review the FIPS 140 validation report to confirm compliance with New Zealand National Cryptographic Policy.</paragraph></block><block title="New Zealand National Policy for High Grade Cryptographic Products, High Grade Cryptographic Equipment and Key Management"><paragraph title="17.1.30.">The New Zealand National Standard for High Grade Cryptographic Products (HGCP) &amp; High Grade Cryptographic Equipment (HGCE) and related key management is contained in the New Zealand Communications Security Standard No. 300 &#x2013; Control of COMSEC Material. &#xA0;This prescribes national doctrine for the control of COMSEC materials. &#xA0;Note this is a RESTRICTED document.</paragraph></block><block title="Protection of RESTRICTED/SENSITIVE information in transit over public systems"><paragraph title="17.1.31.">The physical requirements for protection of information classified RESTRICTED/SENSITIVE are provided by the classification system and PSR guidance.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.32.">Where such information is generated and held on information systems (any computer device, including laptops, mobile phones, tablets, desktop and networked systems), the requirements of the NZISM apply. Of particular note is the requirement to encrypt RESTRICTED/SENSITIVE data when in transit over public systems, including any Internet connection, public network or any other network NOT directly controlled by the agency.</paragraph></block><block title="Encryption and Key Management"><paragraph title="17.1.33.">Encryption is necessary to protect the information while in transit and while NOT under the direct control of the agency.&#xA0; The use of encryption (also including data encryption, use of a VPN or some other form of protection using cryptography) must also consider cryptographic key management and the retention of control of key management.&#xA0; Where cloud services are used it is essential that the protection of data at rest is also considered.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.34.">Where agencies make use of VPN/ MPLS services provided by an ISP, Telco or other service provider, the control and management of the cryptographic key is fundamental to the integrity and security of the encrypted data.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.35.">If your encryption keys are compromised, then any authentication and encryption mechanisms, no matter how robust or comprehensive, are futile.&#xA0; Further risks include the loss of access to encrypted data and the potential to expose all data and systems if keys are maliciously or accidentally replaced.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.36.">The selection of the cryptographic protocol and algorithm is described in the NZISM, Chapter 17 and specified in 17.1.48.C.02. It is essential that agencies select and use only approved cryptographic algorithms and protocols and apply the cryptographic key management requirements of the NZISM, see section 17.9 - Key Management.</paragraph></block><block title="Direct Control / Agency Control"><paragraph title="17.1.37.">In relation to the NZISM, Direct Control is the immediate and continuous physical and logical control, responsibility for, protection and operation of agency information systems and data.&#xA0; In the NZISM, Agency Control is synonymous with Direct Control.</paragraph></block><block title="Non-Agency Control"><paragraph title="17.1.38.">Where agencies outsource the management of data centres it follows that they do NOT have direct control over the data centre and related gateways.&#xA0; In other cases the operation of systems within an agency are also outsourced.&#xA0; In such cases encryption MUST be applied at the transmitting device as this is the logical point at which direct agency control ceases.&#xA0; In large agencies, this is likely to be impractical and creates a significant key management overhead.&#xA0; Encryption for routine traffic originating at the transmitting device is therefore likely to occur only in exceptional cases or where special protection is required.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.39.">The determination of when and where a communication/transmission leaves direct agency control will depend on a number of factors including:
< The scope and extent of outsourcing and information systems support agreements with service providers;
< Service agreements with ISP&#x2019;s, Telcos and other communication service providers;
< The agency&#x2019;s system architecture and security architecture.&#xA0; In particular the boundary where direct agency control ceases.&#xA0; In traditional network architectures this was described as the &#x201C;gateway&#x201D;;
< Key management and control of the application of keys when encrypting/decrypting;
< The use of Hardware Security Modules (HSM&#x2019;s- refer to section 17.10).
< </paragraph></block><block title="VPN connection Security"><paragraph title="17.1.40.">The types of encryption, protocols, and cryptographic algorithms applied in the establishment and maintenance of a VPN connection are fundamental to the security and integrity of the connection.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.41.">Key aspects of VPN security include:

The encryption selected may change depending on the classification of the data.&#xA0; It is important to note that classification, in itself, provides no protection but is merely a labelling mechanism to indicate the degree of protection and care required in handling that data.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.5.">Cryptography is frequently used in the establishment of secure connectivity (e.g. IPSec VPNs) and in trust frameworks such as those supported by Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.6.">With the increases in speed and computing power and the cost reductions of modern computing, older cryptographic algorithms are increasingly vulnerable. &#xA0;It is vital that recommendations and controls in the NZISM are followed.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.7.">Mitigation of the risks when using older cryptographic algorithms, often takes the form of increased key lengths.&#xA0; Agencies should also note the increasing threat posed by the evolution and development of quantum computing (see 17.1.19 - Quantum Computing and Encryption).</paragraph></block><block title="Encryption"><paragraph title="17.1.8.">Encryption is the process of converting plain (readable) text to an unintelligible form (cipher text).&#xA0; The term encryption is often used synonymously with cryptography.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.9.">The use of approved encryption will generally reduce the likelihood of an unauthorised party gaining access to the information contained within the encrypted data.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.10.">When data is at rest, encryption can be used to reduce the physical protection and handling requirements of media or systems. This does not change the classification of the underlying data system or equipment.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.11.">Care needs to be taken with encryption systems that do not encrypt the entire media content to ensure that either all of the classified data is encrypted or that the media is handled in accordance with the highest classification of the unencrypted data.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.12.">Encryption of data in transit can be used to provide protection for information being communicated over insecure media and hence reduce the security requirements of the communication process.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.13.">It is important to note that when agencies use encryption for data at rest or in transit, they are not reducing the classification of the information. When encryption is used the potential risk of disclosure of the information is reduced.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.14.">As the classification of the information does not change when encrypted, agencies cannot use lowered storage, physical transfer or security requirements as a baseline to further lower requirements with an additional cryptographic product.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.15.">In general terms, the level of assurance of specific encryption protocols and algorithms is defined in terms of Common Criteria, Protection Profiles or, in some cases, approved cryptographic evaluations.&#xA0; It is important to note that evaluations of cryptographic protocols and algorithms are NOT universally conducted when security products are evaluated, relying rather on previous approved evaluations of cryptographic protocols and algorithms.</paragraph></block><block title="Risk Assessments"><paragraph title="17.1.16.">Encryption algorithms apply data transformations that are designed to be difficult to reverse by unauthorised users.&#xA0; Today&#x2019;s software will usually provide several algorithmic options, but may include some older algorithms provided for backward compatibility with older (legacy) systems.&#xA0; In many cases the older algorithms are deprecated, are considered time-expired and are not fit for purpose in modern systems. Deprecated algorithms should not be used.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.17.">In all cases a comprehensive risk assessment should be undertaken before configurations are selected.&#xA0; Some general principles to be considered are:
> Cryptographic strength is determined by a combination of the encryption algorithm being used, the encryption protocol and the key length.&#xA0; Longer keys generally provide increased encryption strength over shorter keys when using the same encryption algorithm;
> Asymmetric cryptographic algorithms are slower than symmetric cryptographic algorithms at an equivalent cryptographic strength;
> Asymmetric cryptographic algorithms are recommended for the exchange of symmetric cryptographic keys when they are needed to be shared across communication channels;
> Encrypted data cannot usually be compressed, but compressed data can be encrypted.&#xA0; Data should be compressed before encryption;
> Encryption keys have the same requirements for handling and storage as the unencrypted data they are being used to protect;
> Any risk assessment should include consideration of key management &#x2013; refer to section 17.9 Key Management.
> </paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.18.">It is important to note that the NZISM prescribes approved algorithms and protocols and users must select combinations from these lists.</paragraph></block><block title="Quantum Computing and Encryption"><paragraph title="17.1.19.">Developments in quantum computing have highlighted threats to classical cryptography whereby a quantum computing, can undermine all of the widely used public key algorithms used for key establishment and digital signatures.&#xA0; While this may be not an immediate issue, quantum developments are likely to undermine the effectiveness of encryption being used today to protect confidentiality of information.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.20.">A further implication is that historical and archived data protected by encryption may be at risk.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.21.">It is generally accepted that symmetric encryption, with sufficiently long keys, will remain quantum resistant in the short term but that quantum resistant replacements for digital signature and key establishment algorithms will be required in the near future.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.22.">In the longer term, quantum resistant algorithms are expected to be developed, standardised and approved for use.&#xA0; Until such time, however, agencies should be positioning themselves to be ready to migrate to a &#x201C;post-quantum encryption&#x201D; environment.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.23.">As it is now recognised that agencies will need to undertake future migration activities related to post-quantum encryption, it is no longer specifically advised to invest in migration from RSA to ECC-based algorithms if that has not already taken place.&#xA0; Emphasis should instead be placed on ensuring minimum key lengths specified in the NZISM are adhered to.</paragraph></block><block title="Transitioning Cryptographic Algorithms and Protocols"><paragraph title="17.1.24.">It is important to use algorithms that adequately protect sensitive information.&#xA0; It is also important to recognise that all cryptographic algorithms and protocols have a finite life.&#xA0; Challenges are posed by new cryptanalysis techniques and methods, the increasing power of classical computing technology, and the continuing work on the development of quantum computers.&#xA0; In addition, there is an active field of work that continuously seeks to compromise algorithms and protocols currently in&#xA0;use.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.25.">Planning for changes in the use of cryptography because of algorithm breaks, the availability of more powerful computing techniques or new technologies is an important consideration for agencies.&#xA0; Awareness of retirement or deprecation of algorithms and associated protocols is essential.</paragraph></block><block title="RSA "><paragraph title="17.1.26.">RSA was announced in 1976 and is now over 45 years old. Several flaws and attacks have been identified since creation, each of which required specific mitigations, careful implementation and management.&#xA0; Unfortunately there is ample evidence that implementers continue to have difficulties in securely implementing, using and managing RSA.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.27.">To counter identified threats from shorter RSA key lengths, longer key lengths have been specified in the NZISM since 2010.&#xA0; Minimum key lengths have been subsequently increased over time.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.28.">For a number of years there had been several indicators that RSA was likely to be deprecated by the cryptographic community and standards bodies.&#xA0; For example, TLS 1.3 has deprecated the use of RSA for key exchange in favour of elliptic curve cryptography, but RSA is still supported for digital signatures in the current standard.&#xA0; Previous guidance from NIST was also indicative of the impending deprecation of RSA.&#xA0; However, subsequent guidance no longer recommends moving from RSA to elliptic curve if that has not already been done.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.29.">Therefore, while RSA is not fully deprecated in the NZISM, it is approved ONLY for a limited set of uses as described in Section 17.2 &#x2013; Approved Cryptographic Algorithms.</paragraph></block><block title="Product specific cryptographic requirements"><paragraph title="17.1.30.">This section provides requirements for the use of cryptography to protect classified information.&#xA0; Requirements, in addition to those in this Manual, can exist in consumer guides for products once they have completed an approved evaluation.&#xA0; Vendor specifications supplement this manual and where conflict in controls occurs the product specific requirements take precedence.&#xA0; Any policy or compliance conflicts are to be incorporated into the risk assessment.</paragraph></block><block title="Exceptions for using cryptographic products"><paragraph title="17.1.31.">Where Agencies implement a product that uses an Approved Cryptographic Algorithm or Approved Cryptographic Protocol to provide protection of unclassified data at rest or in transit, that product does not require a separate, approved evaluation. &#xA0;Correct implementation of the cryptographic protocol is fundamental to the proper operation of the Approved Cryptographic Algorithm or Approved Cryptographic Protocol and is part of the checking conducted during system certification.</paragraph></block><block title="Federal Information Processing Standard 140"><paragraph title="17.1.32.">FIPS 140 is a United States standard for the evaluation and validation of both hardware and software cryptographic modules.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.33.">FIPS 140 is in its third iteration and is formally referred to as FIPS 140-3.&#xA0; This section refers to the standard as FIPS 140 but this should be considered to encompass FIPS 140-1, FIPS 140-2 and FIPS 140-3.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.34.">FIPS 140 is not a substitute for an approved evaluation of a product with cryptographic functionality. &#xA0;FIPS 140 is concerned solely with the cryptographic functionality of a module and does not consider any other security functionality.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.35.">Cryptographic evaluations of products will normally be conducted by an approved agency. &#xA0;Where a product&#x2019;s cryptographic functionality has been validated under FIPS 140, the GCSB can, at its discretion, and in consultation with the vendor, reduce the scope of a cryptographic evaluation.</paragraph></block><block title="New Zealand National Policy for High Assurance Cryptographic Equipment and Key Management"><paragraph title="17.1.36.">The New Zealand National Standard for High Assurance Cryptographic Equipment (HACE) and related key management is contained in the New Zealand Communications Security Standard No. 301 &#x2013; Safeguarding of Communications Security (COMSEC) Material.&#xA0; This prescribes national doctrine for the safeguarding of COMSEC materials.&#xA0; New Zealand Communications Security Standard No. 301 &#x2013; Safeguarding of Communications Security (COMSEC) Material, replaces New Zealand Communications Security Standard No. 300 &#x2013; Control of COMSEC Material which is now withdrawn. Note NZCSI 301 is a RESTRICTED document.</paragraph></block><block title="Protection of RESTRICTED/SENSITIVE information in transit over public systems"><paragraph title="17.1.37.">The physical requirements for protection of information classified RESTRICTED/SENSITIVE are provided by the classification system and PSR guidance.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.38.">Where such information is generated and held on information systems (any computer device, including laptops, mobile phones, tablets, desktop and networked systems), the requirements of the NZISM apply. Of particular note is the requirement to encrypt RESTRICTED/SENSITIVE data when in transit over public systems, including any Internet connection, public network or any other network NOT directly controlled by the agency.</paragraph></block><block title="Encryption and Key Management"><paragraph title="17.1.39.">Direct agency control is described as the immediate and continuous physical and logical control, responsibility for, protection and operation of agency information systems and data (see 2.2.4).</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.40.">Indirect agency control is described as when information is not under the direct control of the agency, this may be through outsourcing, ICT management or services, third party facilities such as data centre co-locations, or consumption of cloud services (see 2.2.5 &#x2013; 2.2.7).</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.41.">Encryption can be used to protect information not under the direct control of the agency.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.42.">The use of encryption (including data encryption, use of a VPN or any other form of protection using cryptography) requires cryptographic key management and the retention of control of both keys and key management processes.&#xA0;</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.43.">Where agencies make use of VPNs or other forms of network connectivity that protect data in transit, the control and management of the cryptographic key is fundamental to the integrity and confidentiality of the encrypted data.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.44.">If encryption keys are compromised, then any authentication and encryption mechanisms that rely on those keys, no matter how robust or comprehensive, are futile.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.45.">If encryption keys are lost, damaged, or fail then access to data encrypted using those keys will also be lost.&#xA0; If control of encryption keys is lost, then those keys should be considered to be compromised and must be replaced or superceded urgently.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.46.">The selection of the cryptographic protocol and algorithm is described in this chapter and specified in 17.1.55.C.02. It is essential that agencies select and use only approved cryptographic algorithms and protocols (see section 17.2 &#x2013; Approved Cryptographic Protocols) and apply the cryptographic key management requirements of the NZISM (see section 17.9 - Key Management).</paragraph></block><block title="VPN connection Security"><paragraph title="17.1.47.">The types of encryption, protocols, and cryptographic algorithms applied in the establishment and maintenance of a VPN connection are fundamental to the security and integrity of the connection.</paragraph><paragraph title="17.1.48.">Key aspects of VPN security include:

With its inclusion in the initial release of the WPA2 standard, it enjoys wide support in wireless access points and in numerous operating systems such as Microsoft Windows, Linux and Apple OS X. EAP-TLS uses a public key infrastructure (PKI) to secure communications between devices and a Remote Access Dial In User Service (RADIUS) server through the use of X.509 certificates. While EAP-TLS provides strong mutual authentication, it requires an agency to have established a PKI. This involves either deploying their own certificate authority and issuing certificates, or purchasing certificates from a commercial certificate authority, for every device that accesses the wireless network. This can introduce additional costs and management overheads but the risk and security management advantages are significant.The EAP-TTLS/MSCHAPv2, or simply EAP-TTLS, method used with WPA2-Enterprise is generally supported through the use of third party software. It has support in multiple operating systems including Microsoft Windows 7, 8, 10 and Server 2012 but does not have native support in earlier versions of Microsoft Windows. EAP-TTLS is different to EAP-TLS in that devices do not authenticate to the server when the initial TLS tunnel is created. Only the server authenticates to devices. Once the TLS tunnel has been created, mutual authentication occurs through the use of another EAP method.An advantage of EAP-TTLS over PEAP is that a username is never transmitted in the clear outside of the TLS tunnel. Another advantage of EAP-TTLS is that it provides support for many legacy EAP methods, while PEAP is generally limited to the use of EAP-MSCHAPv2.PEAPv0/EAP-MSCHAPv2, or simply PEAP, is the second most widely supported EAP method after EAP-TLS. It enjoys wide support in wireless access points and in numerous operating systems such as Microsoft Windows, Linux and Apple OS X. PEAP operates in a very similar way to EAP-TTLS by creating a TLS tunnel which is used to protect another EAP method. PEAP differs from EAP-TTLS in that when the EAP-MSCHAPv2 method is used within the TLS tunnel, only the password portion is protected and not the username. This may allow an intruder to capture the username and replay it with a bogus password in order to lockout the user&#x2019;s account, causing a denial of service for that user. While EAP-MSCHAPv2 within PEAP is the most common implementation, Microsoft Windows supports the use of EAP-TLS within PEAP, known as PEAP-EAP-TLS. This approach is very similar in operation to traditional EAP-TLS yet provides increased protection, as parts of the certificate that are not encrypted with EAP-TLS are encrypted with PEAP-EAP-TLS. The downside to PEAP-EAP-TLS is its support is limited to Microsoft products.</paragraph><paragraph title="18.2.9.R.03.">Ultimately, an agency&#x2019;s choice in authentication method will often be based on the size of their wireless deployment, their security requirements and any existing authentication infrastructure. &#xA0;If an agency is primarily motivated by security they can implement either PEAP-EAP-TLS or EAP-TLS. &#xA0;If they are primarily motivated by flexibility and legacy support they can implement EAP-TTLS. &#xA0;If they are primarily motivated by simplicity they can implement PEAP with EAP-MSCHAPv2.</paragraph><paragraph title="18.2.9.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Must" CID="3319">WPA2-Enterprise with EAP-TLS, WPA2-Enterprise with PEAP-EAP-TLS, WPA2-Enterprise with EAP-TTLS or WPA2-Enterprise with PEAP MUST be used on wireless networks to perform mutual authentication.</paragraph></block><block title="18.2.10. Evaluation of 802.1X authentication implementation"><paragraph title="18.2.10.R.01.">The security of 802.1X authentication is dependent on three main elements and their interaction. &#xA0;These three elements include supplicants (clients) that support the 802.1X authentication protocol, authenticators (wireless access points) that facilitate communication between supplicants and the authentication server, and the authentication server (RADIUS server) that is used for authentication, authorisation and accounting purposes. &#xA0;To provide assurance that these elements have been implemented appropriately, supplicants, authenticators and the authentication server used in wireless networks must have completed an appropriate product evaluation.</paragraph><paragraph title="18.2.10.C.01." classifications="Confidential, Secret, Top Secret" compliances="Must" CID="3326">Supplicants, authenticators and the authentication server used in wireless networks MUST have completed an appropriate product evaluation.</paragraph><paragraph title="18.2.10.C.02." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="3329">Supplicants, authenticators and the authentication server used in wireless networks SHOULD have completed an appropriate product evaluation.</paragraph></block><block title="18.2.11. Issuing certificates for authentication"><paragraph title="18.2.11.R.01.">Certificates for authenticating to wireless networks can be issued to either or both devices and users. &#xA0;For assurance, certificates must be generated using a certificate authority product or hardware security module (HSM) that has completed an appropriate product evaluation.</paragraph><paragraph title="18.2.11.R.02.">When issuing certificates to devices accessing wireless networks, agencies need to be aware of the risk that these certificates could be stolen by malicious software. &#xA0;Once compromised, the certificate could be used on another device to gain unauthorised access to the wireless network. &#xA0;Agencies also need to be aware that in only issuing a certificate to a device, any actions taken by a user will only be attributable to the device and not a specific user.</paragraph><paragraph title="18.2.11.R.03.">When issuing certificates to users accessing wireless networks, they can either be in the form of a certificate that is stored on a device or a certificate that is stored within a smart card. Issuing certificates on smart cards provides increased security, but usually at a higher cost. Security is improved because a user is more likely to notice a missing smart card and alert their local security team, who is then able to revoke the credentials on the RADIUS server. This can minimise the time an intruder has access to a wireless network.</paragraph><paragraph title="18.2.11.R.04.">In addition, to reduce the likelihood of a stolen smart card from being used to gain unauthorised access to a wireless network, two-factor authentication can be implemented through the use of Personal Identification Numbers (PINs) on smart cards. &#xA0;This is essential when a smart card grants a user any form of administrative access on a wireless network or attached network resource.</paragraph><paragraph title="18.2.11.R.05.">For the highest level of security, unique certificates should be issued for both devices and users. In addition, the certificates for a device and user must not be stored on the same device. Finally, certificates for users accessing wireless networks should be issued on smart cards with access PINs and not stored with a device when not in use.</paragraph><paragraph title="18.2.11.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Must" CID="3343">Agencies MUST generate certificates using a certificate authority product or hardware security module that has completed an appropriate product evaluation.</paragraph><paragraph title="18.2.11.C.02." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Must Not" CID="3346">The certificates for both a device and user accessing a wireless network MUST NOT be stored on the same device.</paragraph><paragraph title="18.2.11.C.03." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="3348">Agencies SHOULD use unique certificates for both devices and users accessing a wireless network.</paragraph><paragraph title="18.2.11.C.04." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="3350">Certificates for users accessing wireless networks SHOULD be issued on smart cards with access PINs and not stored with a device when not in use.</paragraph><paragraph title="18.2.11.C.05." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="3351">Certificates stored on devices accessing wireless networks SHOULD be protected by implementing full disk encryption on the devices.</paragraph></block><block title="18.2.12. Using commercial certification authorities for certificate generation"><paragraph title="18.2.12.R.01.">A security risk exists with EAP-TTLS and PEAP when a commercial certificate authority&#x2019;s certificates are automatically trusted by devices using vendor trusted certificate stores. This trust can be exploited by obtaining certificates from a commercial certificate authority under false pretences, as devices can be tricked into trusting their signed certificate. This will allow the capture of authentication credentials presented by devices, which in the case of EAP-MSCHAPv2 can be cracked using a brute force attack granting not only network access but most likely Active Directory credentials as well.To reduce this risk, devices can be configured to:

Selecting wireless access point equipment"><paragraph title="18.2.8.R.01.">Wireless access points that have been certified in a Wi-Fi Alliance certification program provide an agency with assurance that they conform to wireless standards. &#xA0;Deploying wireless access points that are guaranteed to be interoperable with other wireless access points on a wireless network will limit incompatibility of wireless equipment and incorrect implementation of wireless devices by vendors.</paragraph><paragraph title="18.2.8.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Must" CID="3302">All wireless access points used for government wireless networks MUST be Wi-Fi Alliance certified.</paragraph></block><block title="18.2.9. 802.1X Authentication"><paragraph title="18.2.9.R.01.">A number of Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) methods, supported by the Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 (WPA2) protocol, are available.</paragraph><paragraph title="18.2.9.R.02.">Agencies deploying a secure wireless network can choose WPA2-Enterprise with EAP-Transport Layer Security (EAP-TLS), WPA2-Enterprise with EAP-Tunnelled Transport Layer Security (EAP-TTLS) or WPA2-Enterprise with Protected EAP (PEAP) to perform mutual authentication.WPA2-Enterprise with EAP-TLS is considered one of the most secure EAP methods. With its inclusion in the initial release of the WPA2 standard, it enjoys wide support in wireless access points and in numerous operating systems such as Microsoft Windows, Linux and Apple OS X. EAP-TLS uses a public key infrastructure (PKI) to secure communications between devices and a Remote Access Dial In User Service (RADIUS) server through the use of X.509 certificates. While EAP-TLS provides strong mutual authentication, it requires an agency to have established a PKI. This involves either deploying their own certificate authority and issuing certificates, or purchasing certificates from a commercial certificate authority, for every device that accesses the wireless network. This can introduce additional costs and management overheads but the risk and security management advantages are significant.The EAP-TTLS/MSCHAPv2, or simply EAP-TTLS, method used with WPA2-Enterprise is generally supported through the use of third party software. It has support in multiple operating systems including Microsoft Windows 7, 8, 10 and Server 2012 but does not have native support in earlier versions of Microsoft Windows. EAP-TTLS is different to EAP-TLS in that devices do not authenticate to the server when the initial TLS tunnel is created. Only the server authenticates to devices. Once the TLS tunnel has been created, mutual authentication occurs through the use of another EAP method.An advantage of EAP-TTLS over PEAP is that a username is never transmitted in the clear outside of the TLS tunnel. Another advantage of EAP-TTLS is that it provides support for many legacy EAP methods, while PEAP is generally limited to the use of EAP-MSCHAPv2.PEAPv0/EAP-MSCHAPv2, or simply PEAP, is the second most widely supported EAP method after EAP-TLS. It enjoys wide support in wireless access points and in numerous operating systems such as Microsoft Windows, Linux and Apple OS X. PEAP operates in a very similar way to EAP-TTLS by creating a TLS tunnel which is used to protect another EAP method. PEAP differs from EAP-TTLS in that when the EAP-MSCHAPv2 method is used within the TLS tunnel, only the password portion is protected and not the username. This may allow an intruder to capture the username and replay it with a bogus password in order to lockout the user&#x2019;s account, causing a denial of service for that user. While EAP-MSCHAPv2 within PEAP is the most common implementation, Microsoft Windows supports the use of EAP-TLS within PEAP, known as PEAP-EAP-TLS. This approach is very similar in operation to traditional EAP-TLS yet provides increased protection, as parts of the certificate that are not encrypted with EAP-TLS are encrypted with PEAP-EAP-TLS. The downside to PEAP-EAP-TLS is its support is limited to Microsoft products.</paragraph><paragraph title="18.2.9.R.03.">Ultimately, an agency&#x2019;s choice in authentication method will often be based on the size of their wireless deployment, their security requirements and any existing authentication infrastructure. &#xA0;If an agency is primarily motivated by security they can implement either PEAP-EAP-TLS or EAP-TLS. &#xA0;If they are primarily motivated by flexibility and legacy support they can implement EAP-TTLS. &#xA0;If they are primarily motivated by simplicity they can implement PEAP with EAP-MSCHAPv2.</paragraph><paragraph title="18.2.9.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Must" CID="3319">WPA2-Enterprise with EAP-TLS, WPA2-Enterprise with PEAP-EAP-TLS, WPA2-Enterprise with EAP-TTLS or WPA2-Enterprise with PEAP MUST be used on wireless networks to perform mutual authentication.</paragraph></block><block title="18.2.10. Evaluation of 802.1X authentication implementation"><paragraph title="18.2.10.R.01.">The security of 802.1X authentication is dependent on three main elements and their interaction. &#xA0;These three elements include supplicants (clients) that support the 802.1X authentication protocol, authenticators (wireless access points) that facilitate communication between supplicants and the authentication server, and the authentication server (RADIUS server) that is used for authentication, authorisation and accounting purposes. &#xA0;To provide assurance that these elements have been implemented appropriately, supplicants, authenticators and the authentication server used in wireless networks must have completed an appropriate product evaluation.</paragraph><paragraph title="18.2.10.C.01." classifications="Confidential, Secret, Top Secret" compliances="Must" CID="3326">Supplicants, authenticators and the authentication server used in wireless networks MUST have completed an appropriate product evaluation.</paragraph><paragraph title="18.2.10.C.02." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="3329">Supplicants, authenticators and the authentication server used in wireless networks SHOULD have completed an appropriate product evaluation.</paragraph></block><block title="18.2.11. Issuing certificates for authentication"><paragraph title="18.2.11.R.01.">Certificates for authenticating to wireless networks can be issued to either or both devices and users. &#xA0;For assurance, certificates must be generated using a certificate authority product or hardware security module (HSM) that has completed an appropriate product evaluation.</paragraph><paragraph title="18.2.11.R.02.">When issuing certificates to devices accessing wireless networks, agencies need to be aware of the risk that these certificates could be stolen by malicious software. &#xA0;Once compromised, the certificate could be used on another device to gain unauthorised access to the wireless network. &#xA0;Agencies also need to be aware that in only issuing a certificate to a device, any actions taken by a user will only be attributable to the device and not a specific user.</paragraph><paragraph title="18.2.11.R.03.">When issuing certificates to users accessing wireless networks, they can either be in the form of a certificate that is stored on a device or a certificate that is stored within a smart card. Issuing certificates on smart cards provides increased security, but usually at a higher cost. Security is improved because a user is more likely to notice a missing smart card and alert their local security team, who is then able to revoke the credentials on the RADIUS server. This can minimise the time an intruder has access to a wireless network.</paragraph><paragraph title="18.2.11.R.04.">In addition, to reduce the likelihood of a stolen smart card from being used to gain unauthorised access to a wireless network, two-factor authentication can be implemented through the use of Personal Identification Numbers (PINs) on smart cards. &#xA0;This is essential when a smart card grants a user any form of administrative access on a wireless network or attached network resource.</paragraph><paragraph title="18.2.11.R.05.">For the highest level of security, unique certificates should be issued for both devices and users. In addition, the certificates for a device and user must not be stored on the same device. Finally, certificates for users accessing wireless networks should be issued on smart cards with access PINs and not stored with a device when not in use.</paragraph><paragraph title="18.2.11.C.01." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Must" CID="3343">Agencies MUST generate certificates using a certificate authority product or hardware security module that has completed an appropriate product evaluation.</paragraph><paragraph title="18.2.11.C.02." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Must Not" CID="3346">The certificates for both a device and user accessing a wireless network MUST NOT be stored on the same device.</paragraph><paragraph title="18.2.11.C.03." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="3348">Agencies SHOULD use unique certificates for both devices and users accessing a wireless network.</paragraph><paragraph title="18.2.11.C.04." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="3350">Certificates for users accessing wireless networks SHOULD be issued on smart cards with access PINs and not stored with a device when not in use.</paragraph><paragraph title="18.2.11.C.05." classifications="All Classifications" compliances="Should" CID="3351">Certificates stored on devices accessing wireless networks SHOULD be protected by implementing full disk encryption on the devices.</paragraph></block><block title="18.2.12. Using commercial certification authorities for certificate generation"><paragraph title="18.2.12.R.01.">A security risk exists with EAP-TTLS and PEAP when a commercial certificate authority&#x2019;s certificates are automatically trusted by devices using vendor trusted certificate stores. This trust can be exploited by obtaining certificates from a commercial certificate authority under false pretences, as devices can be tricked into trusting their signed certificate. This will allow the capture of authentication credentials presented by devices, which in the case of EAP-MSCHAPv2 can be cracked using a brute force attack granting not only network access but most likely Active Directory credentials as well.To reduce this risk, devices can be configured to:

> 
> Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a framework of business processes, policies and technologies that enable and support the management of electronic or digital identities, authorisation, privileges and access to organisational resources.
> Identity management deals with attributes related to a user (including people, machines, devices and systems).&#xA0;Access Management applies organisation processes, policies and security to enable and manage access.&#xA0;The two aspects are highly interdependent and are most effectively managed conjointly.&#xA0;An IAM framework is a key element in Privileged Access Management (PAM) and Zero Trust architectures.
