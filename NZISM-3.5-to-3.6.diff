In such cases independent assurance reports are an effective means, possibly the only means, of obtaining some assurance on the service provider&#x2019;s operations.</paragraph><paragraph title="5.8.61.R.02.">No single independent assurance scheme/standard covers the full range of considerations and control requirements of the NZISM. Agencies may find duplication of aspects analysed if multiple schemes are applied. . It is also important to note that none of the common mature assurance schemes cover specific government requirements and handling of Official Information; such as the personnel aspects (PERSEC) of user and administration vetting and security clearances, or sovereignty aspects of the information/data. Careful selection and consideration is required when placing reliance on reports available for a particular outsourced or cloud service.</paragraph><paragraph title="5.8.61.R.03.">Reports from different assurance scheme have varying levels of detail as well as risk area coverage. Selection and usage of reports should be considered in the context of the intended service/system business and information value.Understanding the business and technical risk context will drive the size and depth of a risk assessment, and the associated assurance process. Though even a lighter-weight risk assurance process will follow the C&amp;A process model, such that the CE or authorised delegate is still formally accountable and responsible.Re-use of assessments completed by other agencies is encouraged, noting the business or information value context may differ.

> Always-on VPN services from agency-owned or agency-managed devices.

> How are the communications between the devices and directly accessed services secured?
> How does an agency monitor and account for access made to directly accessed services?

> </paragraph></block><block title="Mandates, directives and requirements"><paragraph title="23.1.6.">In August 2013, the government introduced their approach to cloud computing, establishing a &#x2018;cloud first&#x2019; policy and an All-of-Government direction to cloud services development and deployment. This is enabled by the Cabinet Minute [CAB&#xA0;Min&#xA0;(13)&#xA0;37/6B].</paragraph><paragraph title="23.1.7.">Under the &#x2018;cloud first&#x2019; policy public service agencies are expected to adopt approved cloud services either when faced with new procurements, or an upcoming contract extension decision.</paragraph><paragraph title="23.1.8.">In July 2016, Cabinet subsequently agreed that agencies can also use public cloud to deliver office productivity services, provided they comply with security guidance issued by the GCDO and the GCSB [CAB-16-MIN-0316].</paragraph><paragraph title="23.1.9.">Agencies are required to identify and manage risks associated with the use of cloud services through the GCDO Cloud Risk Assessment process [CAB Min (13) 37/6B].&#xA0; More information regarding cloud specific risk management can be found at digital.govt.nz.</paragraph><paragraph title="23.1.10.">Agencies are also required to certify and accredit their ICT systems and services, including those delivered through cloud technologies. &#xA0;Chapter 4 of this manual describes the certification and accreditation processes and these also apply to cloud services.</paragraph><paragraph title="23.1.11.">CAB Min (13) 37/6B directs that no data classified above RESTRICTED may be held in a public cloud.</paragraph></block><block title="Background"><paragraph title="23.1.12.">Adopting or using cloud services introduces new approaches to:
> Workload descriptions and management.
> Procurement and contract management.
> Virtualisation and the separation of resources using hyperscale technologies and strict control-plane/data-plane, tenant/tenant and tenant/provider segregation.
> Key information security services used to control the information boundary: using identity, directories and authorisation, instead of networks, gateways and firewalls.
> The approach to and selection of critical security services such as intrusion detection, key management, encryption, endpoint controls, privileged and user access management and authentication (including MFA).
> </paragraph></block><block title="Public cloud use within other cloud deployment models"><paragraph title="23.1.13.">All the standard cloud deployment models described by ISO and NIST could incorporate elements of public cloud, including:
> Private cloud, hosted on third party public cloud infrastructure.
> Multi cloud, combining elements of different vendors&#x2019; public cloud services.
> Hybrid cloud, combining elements of private and public cloud services.
> </paragraph><paragraph title="23.1.14.">The focus of this chapter is on security concerns related to the use of public cloud technologies irrespective of the cloud service&#x2019;s primary deployment model.&#xA0; This is to avoid these concerns being considered out of scope due to inconsistencies in definitions being applied.</paragraph></block><block title="Characteristics of public cloud"><paragraph title="23.1.15.">There is not a single accepted definition of exactly what constitutes public cloud.&#xA0; Typically public cloud refers to cloud services that are generally available for anyone to use and are accessed through the Internet.</paragraph><paragraph title="23.1.16.">For the avoidance of doubt, information in this chapter relates to public cloud services where:
> The infrastructure used to deliver the public cloud services is not owned by the agency (i.e., server hardware, network devices).
> The cloud infrastructure is shared between many customers (&#x2018;multi-tenanted&#x2019;) and is accessible from the Internet.
> Service provisioning is automated and customer managed.
> There is strict isolation between customer instances, and between customer instances and the service provider&#x2019;s management plane.
> Customer data is isolated and controls are in place that strictly manage access by the service provider.
> There is a defined shared responsibility matrix for ensuring the services meet customer security requirements.&#xA0; It should be noted that regardless of the model, agencies will retain ultimate accountability for the security of their information.
> There is limited flexibility in how the services are configured, and in at least some aspects there may be no flexibility to customise the service.
> </paragraph></block><block title="Responsibility for security in public cloud is necessarily shared"><paragraph title="23.1.17.">Agencies share responsibility for the security of their public cloud environments with their cloud service providers.</paragraph><paragraph title="23.1.18.">Due to differences in how cloud providers operate, there is no single model that can fully describe the boundary between agency security responsibilities and those of the cloud service provider.&#xA0; Cloud service provider responsibilities may even vary between their different service offerings.</paragraph><paragraph title="23.1.19.">The following is an example of how responsibilities for security in a cloud service could be shared, although every service is different:&#xA0;</paragraph><paragraph title="23.1.20.">It is essential that agencies understand where the cloud service provider&#x2019;s responsibilities end and their own begin for each cloud service they consume, so there is no gap left unaddressed.</paragraph><paragraph title="23.1.21.">Agency security processes, such as certification and accreditation or incident response, must be revised to ensure compatibility with their cloud service provider&#x2019;s responsibilities.</paragraph></block><block title="Risks and benefits associated with public cloud services"><paragraph title="23.1.22.">Public cloud services can provide agencies with significant security benefits when adopted in a controlled and well understood manner, including:
> Pervasive identity and authorisation model.
> Consistent, software-orchestrated environments running immutable workloads.
> Automated response to security incidents or misconfigurations.
> Fine-grained access control.
> Scalable logging, monitoring and audit.
> Improved levels of baseline security.
> Enhanced visibility of security state.
> </paragraph><paragraph title="23.1.23.">The use of public cloud services introduces additional specific risks that require careful control selection to manage.</paragraph><paragraph title="23.1.24.">The following examples highlight key areas of public cloud-specific risks that need to be understood and managed:
> Traditional barriers limiting the movement of agency data across legal jurisdictions can be significantly reduced through the use of cloud services.
> Cloud service provider self-service tools can be subject to manipulation impacting agency infrastructure.
> Agency systems delivered using cloud services are typically accessible from the Internet, including management interfaces, unless controls are put in place.
> Agency data is stored on shared platforms, in multiple locations, with agencies ultimately being accountable for ensuring information is secured.
> Cloud environments present large, high value targets, where single exploits can impact large numbers of customers.
> Cloud services are easier to consume without needing to involve common governance processes, such as change control, increasing the risk of using shadow services without adequate information security controls in place.
> On-demand services, coupled with rapid-elasticity, can lead to inappropriate use of agency cloud environments.&#xA0; Agencies are responsible for tracking billing and usage metrics and ensuring appropriate controls are in place to manage fiscal constraints.
> </paragraph><paragraph title="23.1.25.">The GCDO Cloud Risk Assessment process is intended to help agencies understand these, and other, risks associated with the use of public cloud.&#xA0;</paragraph></block><block title="Public cloud impacts on security control selection"><paragraph title="23.1.26.">Depending on whether responsibility for implementing security controls rests on the cloud service provider or the agency, enterprise security controls or standards may not be possible to implement uniformly in public cloud services, for example:
> Agents used to manage configuration or collect system telemetry may not be able to be deployed across public cloud services.
> Log messages may not be able to be centrally collected, or log information tailored to agency requirements, from public cloud services.
> Network information, such as packet captures, may not be feasible to collect.
> Traditional security devices, such as firewalls and proxy servers, may not be able to be deployed.
> </paragraph></block><block title="Security boundaries in cloud"><paragraph title="23.1.27.">Security boundaries exist to identify where differing security requirements and policies need to be applied to information and infrastructure assets operated in support of agency outcomes.&#xA0; Well defined security boundaries are a key construct in support of:
> Protecting environments by providing control enforcement points to manage information flows between internal systems and externally to the environment.
> Providing containment points where the impact of incidents can be limited in scope, which also aids in recovery.
> </paragraph><paragraph title="23.1.28.">Well defined security boundaries can ensure that information is accessible for authorised users and that restrictions do not limit those users&#x2019; access to information to which they are entitled.</paragraph><paragraph title="23.1.29.">There are three key constructs used to describe security policy boundaries in the NZISM.&#xA0; These are classification, security domain and trust zone. &#xA0;Information and systems are subject to the combined requirements described in these policies.&#xA0;</paragraph><paragraph title="23.1.30.">In public cloud, the classified system refers to the highest level of classified information that can be stored, or processed, by systems in the agency&#x2019;s cloud environment.&#xA0; The highest level of classified information the classified system can store or process is based on the lower of:
> The highest classification the system is accredited to operate at, AND
> The lowest clearance level authorised users of the system hold.
> The highest classification of information a classified system in public cloud can be accredited to operate with is RESTRICTED.</paragraph><paragraph title="23.1.31.">Minimum security requirements based on classification are described in the Protective Security Requirements and the NZISM.</paragraph><paragraph title="23.1.32.">A security domain in public cloud can be categorised as a group of trust zones operating under a common set of security requirements and policies.&#xA0; These security requirements and policies are formed through a combination of:
> Minimum security control requirements from the PSR and NZISM, determined by the classification.
> Security control requirements to manage the unique threat environment presented by the use of the public cloud services.
> Additional security control requirements to manage specific risks identified through risk assessments.
> </paragraph><paragraph title="23.1.33.">Examples of the unique threat environment related to the use of public cloud services include:
> Access to the underlying infrastructure by the public cloud service provider systems and staff.
> Differing relative importance of security controls, such as identity, and the addition of different types of privileged access such as for managing service subscriptions and billing (including terminating services) that can have immediate effect.
> Geographic locations where the public cloud services are being delivered from.
> Security controls being defined and implemented by the public cloud service provider.
> The ease of extending access to third parties, including third party applications, through in-built federation and directory integration services in public cloud.
> The ease of shifting data between services and geographic locations in public cloud environments compared to on-premise systems.
> The control and visibility of the security state of the underlying infrastructure platforms, including the physical hosting environment.
> </paragraph><paragraph title="23.1.34.">Defining trust zones provides a mechanism to differentiate security controls used to manage access to information and services within an agency&#x2019;s public cloud environment.</paragraph><paragraph title="23.1.35.">In the public cloud environment, trust zones represent combinations of public cloud services (made up of user, system and data objects) that are authorised to interact with each other and are protected by a common set of security capabilities. &#xA0;The security controls associated with these security capabilities are applied at policy enforcement points:</paragraph><paragraph title="23.1.36.">Traditional policy enforcement point implementations based on location-based network perimeter security controls can be difficult to successfully replicate in public cloud environments.&#xA0;</paragraph><paragraph title="23.1.37.">In public cloud, access control policy enforcement points are tied to authorised combinations of user, system, and data object identities.</paragraph></block><block title="Security boundaries between cloud providers and customers"><paragraph title="23.1.38.">A significant difference between public cloud and traditional computing is the additional set of administration services used by the cloud service provider to manage the overall cloud platform.</paragraph><paragraph title="23.1.39.">Some of these administration services are exposed to tenants to facilitate tenancy management, such as maintaining customer contact and billing details or creating and deleting top level tenant resources.&#xA0; In some circumstances, third parties can be provided access to perform these actions on behalf of tenants.</paragraph><paragraph title="23.1.40.">Due to the significant impact from a compromise, access to these services and the associated privileged identities requires a high degree of trust in those responsible.&#xA0; Ensuring separation of duties (i.e., multi-user authorisation, see section 16.7.19) in this area is highly recommended. </paragraph></block><block title="Virtualisation and multi-tenant security in public cloud"><paragraph title="23.1.41.">Within a public cloud environment adequately architected, designed, and implemented virtualisation technologies can be used to provide isolation between tenants and separation between security domains.</paragraph><paragraph title="23.1.42.">Public cloud service providers that are designed to use technology to implement strict isolation between tenant environments, and separate customer management from platform management, are more likely to provide adequately architected security controls to support security domain separation in a virtualised environment.</paragraph><paragraph title="23.1.43.">Examples of adequately architected security controls that support tenant isolation in public cloud services can include:
> Zero touch configuration of infrastructure using well defined infrastructure as code pipelines.
> Separation of the cloud provider platform&#x2019;s administrative control interfaces from customer accessible tenant management services.
> An inability for cloud provider staff to access customer data except through customer authorised access channels (i.e., the platform does not provide &#x2018;back door&#x2019; access to customer data).
> </paragraph><paragraph title="23.1.44.">At a minimum, a security domain control boundary exists between components where different parties undertake configuration and management responsibilities. </paragraph></block><block title="Collaboration between agencies in public cloud"><paragraph title="23.1.45.">Public cloud services, due to their multi-tenant design and support for integration to multiple identity providers, can provide a convenient platform for collaboration systems between agencies.</paragraph><paragraph title="23.1.46.">It is usually not possible, nor desirable, to implement traditional DMZ or Landing Zone network architectures to facilitate third party access to an agency&#x2019;s public cloud services where collaboration is the goal.</paragraph><paragraph title="23.1.47.">For public cloud collaboration systems, it is often more practical to grant access to individual third party identities, or to federate (i.e., trust) the third party&#x2019;s identity service to perform authentication on the collaboration system&#x2019;s behalf.</paragraph><paragraph title="23.1.48.">When multiple identity systems are used to control access to shared public cloud collaboration systems, the shared system operates to a common policy that covers all of the participating agencies security requirements.</paragraph><paragraph title="23.1.49.">The common policy reflects a different security domain from each of the participating agencies, providing the equivalence of a DMZ environment in public cloud. </paragraph><paragraph title="23.1.50.">When systems are operating in separate security domains, agencies must follow the guidance regarding Information transfer and release in public cloud described in this chapter of the NZISM.</paragraph></block><block title="Information transfer and release in public cloud"><paragraph title="23.1.51.">Information being released from trust zones, destined either internally or externally to the security domain, must always follow the requirements for Data management described in Chapter 20 and Gateway security described in Chapter 19 of the NZISM.&#xA0; This includes where data is being backed up or replicated to systems operating in a different trust zone.</paragraph></block></subsection><subsection title="References"><paragraph title="23.1.52.">Further references can be found at:

> introduces a third party into the process (as in the case of public cloud or hosted private cloud); or
> potentially alters internal governance structures (as in the case of self-hosted private cloud).
> </paragraph><paragraph title="23.2.5.">The primary issue to remember when governing cloud computing is that an organisation can never outsource responsibility for governance, even when using external providers. This is always true, cloud or not, but is useful to keep in mind when navigating cloud computing&#x2019;s concept of shared responsibility.</paragraph><paragraph title="23.2.6.">As with any outsourcing arrangement, agencies bear ultimate responsibility for identifying and managing these risks even if they rely on their cloud service provider to implement mitigating controls.</paragraph><paragraph title="23.2.7.">Cloud services that are hosted or managed from outside New Zealand pose jurisdictional, data sovereignty, and privacy risks. Even when the service is hosted in New Zealand and subject to New Zealand law, an overseas provider may also be subject to its home country&#x2019;s privacy, data access, and lawful intercept legislation, which may conflict with New Zealand law.</paragraph><paragraph title="23.2.8.">Cloud services that support multiple agencies or All-of-Government capabilities also pose governance and risk management challenges that must be addressed by establishing privacy, security, and compliance policies in order to protect the corporate assets and intellectual property of participating organisations&#x2019; data.</paragraph></block><block title="Obligations and responsibilities"><paragraph title="23.2.9.">Agencies must be aware of their statutory and regulatory obligations to protect Official, Classified and personal information and data.&#xA0; Any move to using cloud services cannot allow compromise of these statutory obligations.</paragraph></block><block title="Cloud contracts"><paragraph title="23.2.10.">Cloud contracts should consider data stewardship, data sovereignty, jurisdiction, storage and access, including any backups.&#xA0; It remains, however, the responsibility of individual agencies to ensure their legislative and regulatory responsibilities for data stewardship are met.</paragraph><paragraph title="23.2.11.">As with any outsourcing arrangement, use of cloud services carries the risk of the provider going out of business or otherwise being unable to provide contracted services to the consuming agency. This is a commercial risk that technical security controls cannot address, but one agencies need to consider as part of their due diligence.</paragraph><paragraph title="23.2.12.">It is essential that appropriate legal advice is taken before any cloud contracts are finalised.</paragraph></block><block title="Regular assurance checks"><paragraph title="23.2.13.">Changes made to a cloud tenancy may have an adverse impact on the security posture of an agency&#x2019;s cloud service configuration. Usually, in such circumstances (e.g., if the change was initiated by the agency on-site) this may trigger the commencement of the certification and accreditation process. In addition, changes would usually be subject to approval, review, and testing, as part of an agency&#x2019;s IT change control process. However, this may not be the case in a cloud environment, as platform changes are made by the cloud service provider and may occur with minimal or no notice (see section 5.8 &#x2013; Independent assurance reports).</paragraph></block></subsection><subsection title="References"><paragraph title="23.2.14.">Further references can be found at:

> </paragraph></block><block title="Overview"><paragraph title="23.3.6.">Public cloud services introduce new areas of risk associated with the management of identity and access, including:
> Separation between identity providers and relying parties, with differing standards and capabilities for authentication, assignment of privileges, and access provisioning/deprovisioning.
> Ubiquitous access to public cloud services, and in particular cloud administration services, from the internet.
> The decoupling of the authentication and authorisation steps as part of access control (i.e., separation of the identity provider and the policy decision point/policy enforcement point).
> </paragraph><paragraph title="23.3.7.">This section highlights controls agencies can use to manage these cloud identity and access management risks and move towards a Zero Trust approach to information security.</paragraph></block><block title="Public cloud identity providers"><paragraph title="23.3.8.">There are three models of identity management commonly used with public cloud services:
> Cloud accounts based on identities and authentication from other services or systems using identity federation (such as SAML V2.0 or OpenID Connect).
> Cloud identities synchronised from an existing identity system.
> Cloud identities directly provisioned in local cloud service identity stores, either manually or through automation following a standard specification such as the System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM).
> </paragraph><paragraph title="23.3.9.">Due to the differing standards and capabilities offered by both identity providers and relying parties a combination of identity management models may be required to support the use of public cloud services.</paragraph><paragraph title="23.3.10.">Cloud-based identities may be issued and authenticated by different identity providers, each offering their own levels of assurance and receiving their own levels of trust from the identity consumer.</paragraph><paragraph title="23.3.11.">Identity providers are privileged entities that must prove a chain of trust, for example by strong cryptographic signing of authentication responses, to prevent a malicious actor tampering with authentication traffic as it passes between the provider and the relying party.</paragraph></block><block title="Public cloud access policy enforcement"><paragraph title="23.3.12.">Once an entity is authenticated, access control mechanisms determine what authorised actions are able to be performed and what resources can be interacted with.</paragraph><paragraph title="23.3.13.">Many cloud based system follow Zero Trust principles for access control, with access control determined by a combination of the cloud service&#x2019;s policy decision points and policy enforcement points.</paragraph><paragraph title="23.3.14.">The separation between the authentication and authorisation steps introduces the opportunity for unauthorised access to occur, through:
> Misconfigured mapping between attributes asserted by the authentication provider and their use by the authorisation system.
> Impersonation of authorised users through mimicking the authentication service assertions to the authorisation system.
> Delays between a user being removed from the authentication system and re-authentication occurring.
> </paragraph><paragraph title="23.3.15.">The use of cloud services provides the opportunity to move from purely role-based access control (RBAC) to incorporating more attributes (than just role definitions) as part of attribute-based access control decisions (ABAC).</paragraph></block></subsection><subsection title="References"><paragraph title="23.3.16.">Further references can be found at:

> Cloud services may introduce differences in what information is able to be logged, where it can be logged, and in what format the log messages are constructed.&#xA0; It may not be possible for the consuming agency to customise logging parameters.
> Key security components used by cloud services may be sourced from multiple providers (e.g., identity federation or SaaS integration). Effective log monitoring and incident investigation requires these logs to be accessible and be able to be correlated with each other.
> Some components of the environment where logs are traditionally collected may not be available in cloud environments (e.g., network traffic or boundary devices), or the information may need to be collected in different ways.
